Specifically, we are interested in learning for artificial agents that act in the world, and operationalize “dreaming” as a mechanism by which such an agent can use its own model of the learning environment to generate new hypotheses and training data. We first show that it is not necessarily a given that such a data-hallucination process is useful, since it can easily lead to a training set dominated by spurious imagined data until an ill-defined convergence point is reached. We then analyse a notably successful implementation of a machine learning-based dreaming mechanism by Ha and Schmidhuber (Ha, D., & Schmidhuber, J. (2018). World models. arXiv e-prints, arXiv:1803.10122). On that basis, we then develop a general framework by which an agent can generate simulated data to learn from in a manner that is beneficial to the agent. This, we argue, then forms a general method for an operationalized dream-like mechanism. We finish by demonstrating the general conditions under which such mechanisms can be useful in machine learning, wherein the implicit simulator inference and extrapolation involved in dreaming act without reinforcing inference error even when inference is incomplete.\",\n",

Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research questions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.\",\n",

While traditional optimization methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) remain foundational, the rise of natural language feedback introduces promising new approaches, especially for optimizing non-differentiable systems. This paper provides a systematic review of recent progress in optimizing compound AI systems, encompassing both numerical and language-based techniques.

        "                \"paper_abstract\" : \"Reasoning lies at the heart of intelligence, shaping the ability to make decisions, draw conclusions, and generalize across domains. In artificial intelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and multimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and adaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve comprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular, perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer more coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and reinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges remain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of multimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental roadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging capabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules, where reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation, alignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning into multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) and multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured reasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging benchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the conceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs), which aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in complex, real-world environments.\",\n",

These models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.\",\n",

To leverage planning in unknown environments, the agent needs to learn the dynamics from interactions with the world. However, learning dynamics models that are accurate enough for planning has been a long-standing challenge, especially in image-based domains. We propose the Deep Planning Network (PlaNet), a purely model-based agent that learns the environment dynamics from images and chooses actions through fast online planning in latent space. To achieve high performance, the dynamics model must accurately predict the rewards ahead for multiple time steps. We approach this using a latent dynamics model with both deterministic and stochastic transition components. Moreover, we propose a multi-step variational inference objective that we name latent overshooting. Using only pixel observations, our agent solves continuous control tasks with contact dynamics, partial observability, and sparse rewards, which exceed the difficulty of tasks that were previously solved by planning with learned models. PlaNet uses substantially fewer episodes and reaches final performance close to and sometimes higher than strong model-free algorithms.\",\n",

These methods learn to predict the environment dynamics and expected reward from interaction and use this predictive model to plan and perform the task. However, MBRL methods vary in their fundamental design choices, and there is no strong consensus in the literature on how these design decisions affect performance. In this paper, we study a number of design decisions for the predictive model in visual MBRL algorithms, focusing specifically on methods that use a predictive model for planning. We find that a range of design decisions that are often considered crucial, such as the use of latent spaces, have little effect on task performance. A big exception to this finding is that predicting future observations (i.e., images) leads to significant task performance improvement compared to only predicting rewards. We also empirically find that image prediction accuracy, somewhat surprisingly, correlates more strongly with downstream task performance than reward prediction accuracy. We show how this phenomenon is related to exploration and how some of the lower-scoring models on standard benchmarks (that require exploration) will perform the same as the best-performing models when trained on the same training data. Simultaneously, in the absence of exploration, models that fit the data better usually perform better on the downstream task as well, but surprisingly, these are often not the same models that perform the best when learning and exploring from scratch. These findings suggest that performance and exploration place important and potentially contradictory requirements on the model.\",\n",

However, existing methods fail to meet the needs for efficiency, robustness, and accuracy required by large-scale online applications, making this task still challenging. This paper introduces a novel framework that achieves high accuracy and efficient matching while ensuring robustness in handling diverse scenarios. To improve efficiency, we begin by modeling the online map matching problem as an Online Markov Decision Process (OMDP) based on its inherent characteristics. This approach helps efficiently merge historical and real-time data, reducing unnecessary calculations. Next, to enhance robustness, we design a reinforcement learning method, enabling robust handling of real-time data from dynamically changing environments. In particular, we propose a novel model learning process and a comprehensive reward function, allowing the model to make reasonable current matches from a future-oriented perspective, and to continuously update and optimize during the decision-making process based on feedback. Lastly, to address the heterogeneity between trajectories and roads, we design distinct graph structures, facilitating efficient representation learning through graph and recurrent neural networks. To further align trajectory and road data, we introduce contrastive learning to decrease their distance in the latent space, thereby promoting effective integration of the two. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets confirm that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of accuracy, efficiency and robustness.\",\n",

Previous methods fail to consider all types of interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. We first split the representations of different components in the environment and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal (st) graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the heterogeneous st-graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions among entities through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success and efficiency in challenging navigation scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our pipeline achieves better zero-shot generalization capability than previous works when the densities of humans and obstacles change.

In this paper, we propose a novel training procedure, Birdie, that significantly enhances the in-context retrieval capabilities of SSMs without altering their architecture. Our approach combines bidirectional input processing with dynamic mixtures of specialized pre-training objectives, optimized via reinforcement learning. We introduce a new bidirectional SSM architecture that seamlessly transitions from bidirectional context processing to causal generation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Birdie markedly improves performance on retrieval-intensive tasks such as multi-number phone book lookup, long paragraph question-answering, and infilling.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is hard to scale up as it requires a complex reward design for each task. In contrast, language can specify tasks in a more natural way. Current foundation vision-language models (VLMs) generally require fine-tuning or other adaptations to be adopted in embodied contexts, due to the significant domain gap. However, the lack of multimodal data in such domains represents an obstacle to developing foundation models for embodied applications. In this work, we overcome these problems by presenting multimodal-foundation world models, able to connect and align the representation of foundation VLMs with the latent space of generative world models for RL, without any language annotations. The resulting agent learning framework, GenRL, allows one to specify tasks through vision and/or language prompts, ground them in the embodied domain's dynamics, and learn the corresponding behaviors in imagination. As assessed through large-scale multi-task benchmarking in locomotion and manipulation domains, GenRL enables multi-task generalization from language and visual prompts.

In particular, world models enhance sample efficiency by learning in imagination, which involves training a generative sequence model of the environment in a self-supervised manner. Recently, Masked Generative Modelling has emerged as a more efficient and superior inductive bias for modelling and generating token sequences. Building on the Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models (STORM) architecture, we replace the traditional MLP prior with a Masked Generative Prior (e.g., MaskGIT Prior) and introduce GIT-STORM. We evaluate our model on two downstream tasks: reinforcement learning and video prediction. GIT-STORM demonstrates substantial performance gains in RL tasks on the Atari 100k benchmark. Moreover, we apply Transformer-based World Models to continuous action environments for the first time, addressing a significant gap in prior research. To achieve this, we employ a state mixer function that integrates latent state representations with actions, enabling our model to handle continuous control tasks. We validate this approach through qualitative and quantitative analyses on the DeepMind Control Suite, showcasing the effectiveness of Transformer-based World Models in this new domain.

Recently, there’s a trend to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to TSC. However, many current DRL methods struggle to effectively coordinate intersections as they rely on training policies conditioned on both their own observations and those of neighboring intersections. This approach leads to limited information extraction, subpar performance, and an inability to adapt to changes in neighboring policies. In this paper, we propose WorldLight, a DRL method that incorporates the learning of world models. Specifically, for each intersection, we model its neighbors’ influence as its own underlying traffic flow and train a latent dynamic model with discrete representation to summarise historical observations and predict future underlying traffic flow. Additionally, we leverage Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) purely in the latent space of world models to enhance sample efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the better performance of our method and better adaptability to varying neighboring policies.\",\n",

Thus motivated, we develop a stochastic differential equation formulation by treating the world model learning as a stochastic dynamical system, and characterize the impact of latent representation errors on robustness and generalization, for both cases with zero-drift representation errors and with non-zero-drift representation errors. Our somewhat surprising findings, based on both theoretic and experimental studies, reveal that for the case with zero drift, modest latent representation errors can in fact function as implicit regularization and hence result in improved robustness. We further propose a Jacobian regularization scheme to mitigate the compounding error propagation effects of non-zero drift, thereby enhancing training stability and robustness. Our experimental studies corroborate that this regularization approach not only stabilizes training but also accelerates convergence and improves accuracy of long-horizon prediction.\",\n",

The most common way to estimate dynamics is by fitting a one-step ahead prediction model and using it to recursively propagate the predicted state distribution over long horizons. Unfortunately, this approach is known to compound even small prediction errors, making long-term predictions inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a new parametrization to supervised learning on state-action data to stably predict at longer horizons -- that we call a trajectory-based model. This trajectory-based model takes an initial state, a future time index, and control parameters as inputs, and directly predicts the state at the future time index. Experimental results in simulated and real-world robotic tasks show that trajectory-based models yield significantly more accurate long term predictions, improved sample efficiency, and the ability to predict task reward. With these improved prediction properties, we conclude with a demonstration of methods for using the trajectory-based model for control.\",\n",

For this purpose, we create a world model that combines a vector quantized-variational autoencoder to encode observations and a convolutional long short-term memory to model the dynamics.

Though some recent breakthroughs have used vector-based categorical representations of observations, often referred to as discrete representations, there is little work explicitly assessing the significance of such a choice. In this work, we provide a thorough empirical investigation of the advantages of representing observations as vectors of categorical values within the context of reinforcement learning. We perform evaluations on world-model learning, model-free RL, and ultimately continual RL problems, where the benefits best align with the needs of the problem setting. We find that, when compared to traditional continuous representations, world models learned over discrete representations accurately model more of the world with less capacity, and that agents trained with discrete representations learn better policies with less data. In the context of continual RL, these benefits translate into faster adapting agents. Additionally, our analysis suggests that the observed performance improvements can be attributed to the information contained within the latent vectors and potentially the encoding of the discrete representation itself.\",\n",

This paradigm distinctively addresses two major limitations of traditional continual learning: (1) dynamic model updates using streaming, real-time human-annotated data, rather than static datasets with fixed labels, and (2) the assumption of clean labels, by explicitly handling the noisy feedback common in real-world interactions. To tackle these problems, we propose RiCL, a Reinforced interactive Continual Learning framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn new skills effectively from dynamic feedback. RiCL incorporates three key components: a temporal consistency-aware purifier to automatically discern clean from noisy samples in data streams; an interaction-aware direct preference optimization strategy to align model behavior with human intent by reconciling AI-generated and human-provided feedback; and a noise-resistant contrastive learning module that captures robust representations by exploiting inherent data relationships, thus avoiding reliance on potentially unreliable labels. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (FewRel and TACRED), contaminated with realistic noise patterns, demonstrate that our RiCL approach substantially outperforms existing combinations of state-of-the-art online continual learning and noisy-label learning methods.\",\n",

Among graph-based learning techniques, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has gained significant attention for its ability to derive robust, self-supervised graph representations through the contrasting of positive and negative sample pairs. However, a critical challenge lies in ensuring high-quality positive pairs so that the intrinsic semantic and structural properties of the original graph are preserved rather than distorted. To address this issue, we propose SRGCL (Self-Reinforced Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel framework that leverages the model's own encoder to dynamically evaluate and select high-quality positive pairs. We designed a unified positive pair generator employing multiple augmentation strategies, and a selector guided by the manifold hypothesis to maintain the underlying geometry of the latent space. By adopting a probabilistic mechanism for selecting positive pairs, SRGCL iteratively refines its assessment of pair quality as the encoder's representational power improves. Extensive experiments on diverse graph-level classification tasks demonstrate that SRGCL, as a plug-in module, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GCL methods, underscoring its adaptability and efficacy across various domains.\",\n",

However, despite the improved training efficiency of these methods, their impact on performance remains limited compared to the Dreamer algorithm, struggling to learn competitive Transformer-based world models. In this work, we show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches is insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of Transformers. We propose to extend world model predictions to longer time horizons by introducing TWISTER (Transformer-based World model wIth contraSTivE Representations), a world model using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive Coding to learn high-level temporal feature representations and improve the agent performance.

While various approaches have attempted to alleviate this issue by disentanglement representation learning, these methods usually start learning from scratch without prior knowledge of the world. This paper, in contrast, tries to learn and understand underlying semantic variations from distracting videos via offline-to-online latent distillation and flexible disentanglement constraints. To enable effective cross-domain semantic knowledge transfer, we introduce an interpretable model-based RL framework, dubbed Disentangled World Models (DisWM). Specifically, we pretrain the action-free video prediction model offline with disentanglement regularization to extract semantic knowledge from distracting videos. The disentanglement capability of the pretrained model is then transferred to the world model through latent distillation. For finetuning in the online environment, we exploit the knowledge from the pretrained model and introduce a disentanglement constraint to the world model. During the adaptation phase, the incorporation of actions and rewards from online environment interactions enriches the diversity of the data, which in turn strengthens the disentangled representation learning. Experimental results validate the superiority of our approach on various benchmarks.\",\n",

Due to the coupled action space of behavior and motion, it is challenging to solve HBMP problem using reinforcement learning (RL) for long-horizon driving tasks. We transform HBMP problem by integrating a classical sampling-based motion planner, of which the optimal cost is regarded as the rewards for high-level behavior learning. As a result, this formulation reduces action space and diversifies the rewards without losing the optimality of HBMP. In addition, we propose a sharable representation for input sensory data across simulation platforms and real-world environment, so that models trained in a fast event-based simulator, SUMO, can be used to initialize and accelerate the RL training in a dynamics based simulator, CARLA.

To achieve this, we propose the VLM-based hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) agent that uses Flamingo’s Perceiver Resampler and Cross-Attention mechanism with a causal LLM to capture mission status and suggest promising subgoals. We assess the impact of two design factors, namely the training mode of the pretrained LLM and history representation, through the evaluation of three training modes ( RandomInit , TuneAll , and FrozenAll ) and two history representations ( Full History and Abstract History ). The experiments conducted on the BabyAI platform demonstrate: 1) the VLM-HRL agent outperforms the baseline agent; 2) LLM pretraining is unhelpful for the VLM-HRL agent in environments with less-natural instructions and finetuning serves to undo pretraining; 3) history abstraction enhances learning efficiency and stability.\",\n",

Recently, offline RL has shown the possibility of extracting a solution through existing logged data without online interaction. In this work, we propose an offline hierarchical RL method, Guider (Guide to Control), that can efficiently solve long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks from offline data. The high-level policy sequentially generates a subgoal that can guide the agent to arrive at the final goal, and the lower-level policy learns how to reach each given guided subgoal. In the process of learning from offline data, the key is to make the low-level policy reachable to the generated subgoals. We show that high-quality subgoal generation is possible through pre-training a latent subgoal prior model. The well-regulated subgoal generation improves performance while avoiding distributional shifts in offline RL by breaking down long, complex tasks into shorter, easier ones. For evaluations, Guider outperforms prior offline RL methods in long-horizon robot navigation and complex manipulation benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/gckor/Guider.\",\n",

Recent work has investigated such unsupervised pre-training methods for model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) but is limited to domain-specific or simulated data. In this paper, we study the problem of pre-training world models with abundant in-the-wild videos for efficient learning of downstream visual control tasks. However, in-the-wild videos are complicated with various contextual factors, such as intricate backgrounds and textured appearance, which precludes a world model from extracting shared world knowledge to generalize better. To tackle this issue, we introduce Contextualized World Models (ContextWM) that explicitly separate context and dynamics modeling to overcome the complexity and diversity of in-the-wild videos and facilitate knowledge transfer between distinct scenes. Specifically, a contextualized extension of the latent dynamics model is elaborately realized by incorporating a context encoder to retain contextual information and empower the image decoder, which encourages the latent dynamics model to concentrate on essential temporal variations. Our experiments show that in-the-wild video pre-training equipped with ContextWM can significantly improve the sample efficiency of MBRL in various domains, including robotic manipulation, locomotion, and autonomous driving.

Existing approaches try to acquire a robust representation via diversifying the appearances of in-domain observations for better generalization.

In this paper, we investigate how a visual RL agent would benefit from the off-the-shelf visual representations. Surprisingly, we find that the early layers in an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet model could provide rather generalizable representations for visual RL. Hence, we propose Pre-trained Image Encoder for Generalizable visual reinforcement learning (PIE-G), a simple yet effective framework that can generalize to the unseen visual scenarios in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on DMControl Generalization Benchmark, DMControl Manipulation Tasks, Drawer World, and CARLA to verify the effectiveness of PIE-G. Empirical evidence suggests PIE-G improves sample efficiency and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization performance. In particular, PIE-G boasts a 55% generalization performance gain on average in the challenging video background setting. Project Page: this https URL.\",\n",

In the context of offline reinforcement learning, DWM can be viewed as a conservative value regularization through generative modeling. Alternatively, it can be seen as a data source that enables offline Q-learning with synthetic data. Our experiments on the D4RL dataset confirm the robustness of DWM to long-horizon simulation. In terms of absolute performance, DWM significantly surpasses one-step dynamics models with a $44\\%$ performance gain, and is comparable to or slightly surpassing their model-free counterparts.\",\n",

By predicting the outcome of a sequence of actions, world models enable policies to be optimised via on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) using synthetic data, i.e. '''in imagination'''. Existing world models are autoregressive in that they interleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the policy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows. In this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not autoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass through a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion (PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the action distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random states and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the connections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and classifier-guided diffusion models. Our results demonstrate that PolyGRAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory prediction error for short trajectories, with the exception of autoregressive diffusion. For short trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive diffusion, but with lower computational requirements. For long trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains comparable performance to baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that PolyGRAD enables performant policies to be trained via on-policy RL in imagination for MuJoCo continuous control domains. Thus, PolyGRAD introduces a new paradigm for accurate on-policy world modelling without autoregressive sampling.\",\n",

In this work, we propose CoST, a novel framework that collaborates deterministic and diffusion models for spatiotemporal forecasting. CoST formulates a mean-residual decomposition strategy: it leverages a powerful deterministic model to capture the conditional mean and a lightweight diffusion model to learn residual uncertainties. This collaborative formulation simplifies learning objectives, enhances forecasting accuracy, enables uncertainty quantification, and significantly improves computational efficiency. To address spatial heterogeneity, we further design a scale-aware diffusion mechanism to guide the diffusion process. Extensive experiments across ten real-world datasets from climate, energy, communication, and urban systems show that CoST achieves 25% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly reducing computational cost.\",\n",

The world model's extracted features are fed into compact and simple policies trained by evolution, achieving state of the art results in various environments. We also train our agent entirely inside of an environment generated by its own internal world model, and transfer this policy back into the actual environment.

To achieve this, we propose the VLM-based hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) agent that uses Flamingo\\u2019s Perceiver Resampler and Cross-Attention mechanism with a causal LLM to capture mission status and suggest promising subgoals. We assess the impact of two design factors, namely the training mode of the pretrained LLM and history representation, through the evaluation of three training modes ( RandomInit , TuneAll , and FrozenAll ) and two history representations ( Full History and Abstract History ). The experiments conducted on the BabyAI platform demonstrate: 1) the VLM-HRL agent outperforms the baseline agent; 2) LLM pretraining is unhelpful for the VLM-HRL agent in environments with less-natural instructions and finetuning serves to undo pretraining; 3) history abstraction enhances learning efficiency and stability.\",\n          \"Training visual reinforcement learning (RL) in practical scenarios presents a significant challenge, i.e., RL agents suffer from low sample efficiency in environments with variations. While various approaches have attempted to alleviate this issue by disentanglement representation learning, these methods usually start learning from scratch without prior knowledge of the world. This paper, in contrast, tries to learn and understand underlying semantic variations from distracting videos via offline-to-online latent distillation and flexible disentanglement constraints. To enable effective cross-domain semantic knowledge transfer, we introduce an interpretable model-based RL framework, dubbed Disentangled World Models (DisWM). Specifically, we pretrain the action-free video prediction model offline with disentanglement regularization to extract semantic knowledge from distracting videos. The disentanglement capability of the pretrained model is then transferred to the world model through latent distillation. For finetuning in the online environment, we exploit the knowledge from the pretrained model and introduce a disentanglement constraint to the world model. During the adaptation phase, the incorporation of actions and rewards from online environment interactions enriches the diversity of the data, which in turn strengthens the disentangled representation learning. Experimental results validate the superiority of our approach on various benchmarks.\",\n          \"Learning generalizable policies that can adapt to unseen environments remains challenging in visual Reinforcement Learning (RL). Existing approaches try to acquire a robust representation via diversifying the appearances of in-domain observations for better generalization. Limited by the specific observations of the environment, these methods ignore the possibility of exploring diverse real-world image datasets. In this paper, we investigate how a visual RL agent would benefit from the off-the-shelf visual representations. Surprisingly, we find that the early layers in an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet model could provide rather generalizable representations for visual RL. Hence, we propose Pre-trained Image Encoder for Generalizable visual reinforcement learning (PIE-G), a simple yet effective framework that can generalize to the unseen visual scenarios in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on DMControl Generalization Benchmark, DMControl Manipulation Tasks, Drawer World, and CARLA to verify the effectiveness of PIE-G. Empirical evidence suggests PIE-G improves sample efficiency and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization performance. In particular, PIE-G boasts a 55% generalization performance gain on average in the challenging video background setting.

This approach addresses the challenges faced by model-based reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly in environments with visual inputs. Traditional methods struggle to create accurate models of complex environments, leading to discrepancies that can hinder performance. STORM mitigates these issues by incorporating random noise, enhancing the agent's ability to learn and adapt. The results demonstrate that STORM achieves a mean human performance of 126.7% on the Atari 100k benchmark, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods that do not utilize lookahead search techniques. Additionally, the training efficiency is significantly improved, requiring only 4.3 hours of training time with 1.85 hours of real-time interaction on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, showcasing its potential for practical applications in reinforcement learning.\"}, {'paper_name': nan, 'paper_authors': nan, 'paper_publication': nan, 'paper_publication_date': nan, 'paper_category': nan, 'paper_abstract': nan, 'paper_pdf_link': nan, 'query': 'Combining MCTS search with latent imagination in world models', 'tool': 'Google Search', 'link_title': 'Differentiable Tree Search in Latent State Space', 'link_url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11660v1', 'link_overview': 'In decision-making problems with limited training data, policy functions approximated using deep neural networks often exhibit suboptimal performance.

However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory interpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical challenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework to disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first introduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception uncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision uncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans. To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the unique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal prediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce Formal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty, leveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building on this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an active sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to enhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that fine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet task specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic tasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces variability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to baselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both interventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement, which facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems.

We can even train our agent entirely inside of its own hallucinated dream generated by its world model, and transfer this policy back into the actual environment.

To leverage planning in unknown environments, the agent needs to learn the dynamics from interactions with the world. However, learning dynamics models that are accurate enough for planning has been a long-standing challenge, especially in image-based domains. We propose the Deep Planning Network (PlaNet), a purely model-based agent that learns the environment dynamics from images and chooses actions through fast online planning in latent space. To achieve high performance, the dynamics model must accurately predict the rewards ahead for multiple time steps. We approach this using a latent dynamics model with both deterministic and stochastic transition components. Moreover, we propose a multi-step variational inference objective that we name latent overshooting. Using only pixel observations, our agent solves continuous control tasks with contact dynamics, partial observability, and sparse rewards, which exceed the difficulty of tasks that were previously solved by planning with learned models. PlaNet uses substantially fewer episodes and reaches final performance close to and sometimes higher than strong model-free algorithms.', 'paper_pdf_link': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04551', 'query': 'Learning Latent Dynamics for Planning from Pixels', 'tool': 'Semantic Scholar', 'link_title': nan, 'link_url': nan, 'link_overview': nan}), ({'paper_name': 'Compound AI Systems Optimization: A Survey of Methods, Challenges, and Future Directions', 'paper_authors': 'Yu-Ang Lee, Guan-Ting Yi, Mei-Yi Liu, Jui-Chao Lu, Guan-Bo Yang, Yun-Nung Chen', 'paper_publication': nan, 'paper_publication_date': '9 Jun 2025', 'paper_category': 'Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)', 'paper_abstract': 'Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems have led to a paradigm shift in the design and optimization of complex AI workflows.

However, a critical challenge lies in ensuring high-quality positive pairs so that the intrinsic semantic and structural properties of the original graph are preserved rather than distorted. To address this issue, we propose SRGCL (Self-Reinforced Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel framework that leverages the model's own encoder to dynamically evaluate and select high-quality positive pairs. We designed a unified positive pair generator employing multiple augmentation strategies, and a selector guided by the manifold hypothesis to maintain the underlying geometry of the latent space. By adopting a probabilistic mechanism for selecting positive pairs, SRGCL iteratively refines its assessment of pair quality as the encoder's representational power improves.

WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt.

            "**Observed Phenomenon**\n",
            "Current advanced model-based RL agents, like \"Differentiable Tree Search in Latent State Space\" (DTS), demonstrate strong performance by embedding search algorithms within neural networks and jointly optimizing the world model and search. However, DTS is explicitly stated to be \"currently limited to deterministic decision-making scenarios.\" Separately, \"STORM: Efficient Stochastic Transformer based World Models for Reinforcement Learning\" suggests the advent of effective world models that are both stochastic (handling uncertainty) and employ efficient Transformers (for complex dynamics modeling). There's an empirical gap in combining these sophisticated, learnable search mechanisms with powerful, stochastic, and efficient world models for complex, non-deterministic environments.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Problem Statement:**\n",
            "Many real-world and simulated environments exhibit stochasticity, where an action in a given state can lead to multiple possible next states with varying probabilities. World model-based RL agents that assume deterministic dynamics or use overly simplistic stochastic models struggle in such scenarios due to model inaccuracies, leading to suboptimal planning and poor generalization. The challenge is to develop an agent that can (1) learn an accurate and expressive stochastic model of the environment's dynamics, (2.1) efficiently perform lookahead search using this stochastic model, (2.2) handle the branching factor introduced by stochasticity within a limited computational budget, and (3) jointly optimize the world model and the search strategy to be mutually beneficial.\n",
            "\n",
            "*Condition:* We don’t yet have a widely adopted framework that seamlessly integrates an efficient, Transformer-based *stochastic* world model within an end-to-end *differentiable tree search* mechanism, allowing joint optimization for robust planning in complex, non-deterministic settings.\n",
            "*Consequence:* Agents may fail to learn optimal policies in stochastic environments, exhibit poor sample efficiency, or be brittle to slight changes in dynamics because their internal models and planning processes do not adequately capture or reason about environmental uncertainty. This limits their applicability to a wide range of real-world problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Motivation:**\n",
            "Existing methods like DTS are powerful due to their joint optimization of a learned world model and a differentiable search process. However, their limitation to deterministic worlds restricts their applicability. While methods like TreeQN (mentioned in DTS) perform full tree expansion, this is computationally expensive for deeper search or stochastic branching. Other model-based RL approaches might use stochastic models (e.g., Dreamer-family) but often rely on actor-critic learning in imagined trajectories rather than an explicit differentiable search structure like DTS.\n",
            "\n",
            "The inspiration for this new method comes from two key insights:\n",
            "1.  The title of \"STORM: Efficient Stochastic Transformer based World Models for Reinforcement Learning\" (Paper A) suggests the feasibility of world models that use Transformers to capture complex dynamics *and* explicitly model stochasticity, all while being computationally efficient.\n",
            "2.  \"Differentiable Tree Search in Latent State Space\" (Paper B, DTS) provides a sophisticated, end-to-end differentiable framework for embedding best-first search, which is more efficient than full search and robust to model inaccuracies due to joint optimization. DTS also explicitly mentions the need to \"revamp the transition model to manage stochastic world scenarios\" as future work.\n",
            "\n",
            "Combining these, we propose **STORM-DTS**. This method aims to enhance DTS by incorporating a stochastic, efficient Transformer-based world model (inspired by STORM) as its core transition dynamics module. The differentiable search mechanism of DTS would be adapted to handle probabilistic state transitions. Jointly optimizing this advanced stochastic world model with DTS's search strategy is hypothesized to enable more robust and effective planning in non-deterministic environments than using a deterministic DTS or a stochastic world model with a less integrated/differentiable planner. The efficiency of STORM's Transformer is crucial for managing the computational load of planning with a stochastic model.\n",

            "2.  **Stochastic Transformer Transition Module (`T_θ^STORM`):** This is the key novel component inspired by Paper A. It replaces DTS's deterministic transition module. Given a latent state `h_t` and action `a_t`, `T_θ^STORM` (an efficient Transformer architecture) outputs the parameters of a probability distribution over the next latent state, `p(h_{t+1} | h_t, a_t)`. For example, it could output parameters for a Mixture Density Network or a categorical distribution if latents are discrete.\n",

            "Recent advancements in model-based reinforcement learning have produced powerful, specialized approaches. Methods like \"Differentiable Tree Search in Latent State Space\" (DTS) offer sophisticated, jointly-optimized planning but are explicitly limited to deterministic environments. Conversely, models like the conceptual \"STORM: Efficient Stochastic Transformer based World Models\" (inferred from its title) likely excel at capturing non-deterministic environmental dynamics using Transformers but may not integrate as seamlessly with differentiable, deep search mechanisms as DTS does, often relying on sampling-based planners like MCTS that are not end-to-end optimized with the world model in the same fashion. There is a clear gap in combining the strengths of deep differentiable search with rich stochastic world modeling.\n",

            "**Problem Statement:**\n",
            "Current state-of-the-art differentiable search methods for planning, such as DTS, are primarily designed for deterministic world models. This significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios, which are often inherently stochastic. Stochastic world models, including those potentially based on Transformers like STORM, can represent environmental uncertainties but their integration with planners that allow for deep, differentiable, and jointly optimized search (like DTS) is non-trivial.\n",
            "*Condition:* We lack a framework that allows a differentiable tree search algorithm to effectively and efficiently plan using a world model that explicitly captures stochastic transitions, without resorting to computationally expensive branching for every stochastic outcome within the search tree or losing end-to-end differentiability.\n",

This leads to robust planning, especially in limited-data, offline RL settings. However, its deterministic nature is a critical bottleneck. STORM (Paper A, inferred) likely uses Transformers to create efficient stochastic world models, capable of predicting distributions over next states. Such models are vital for realistic scenarios.\n",
            "The motivation for this research is to bridge this gap: to empower a DTS-like differentiable search mechanism with the ability to plan over a stochastic, Transformer-based world model. Simply sampling from the stochastic model within DTS would make the search tree excessively large and complicate gradients. Instead, we propose a novel integration where the stochastic world model provides a *differentiable summary* (e.g., the mean or mode) of the predicted next-state distribution to guide the tree search. This allows the search tree to maintain a manageable structure similar to deterministic DTS, while the underlying world model explicitly learns and represents environmental stochasticity. This joint optimization of a differentiable planner with a stochastic (Transformer) world model that uses an \"expectation-guided\" approach for tree construction is, to our knowledge, underexplored and could lead to more robust and efficient planning in non-deterministic settings.\n",

Their performance can degrade due to the compounding errors from world model inaccuracies and an inability to effectively represent, predict, and plan under true environmental stochasticity. While DTS (Mittal & Lee, \"Differentiable Tree Search in Latent State Space\") excels by jointly optimizing a deterministic world model with search, it is explicitly limited to deterministic settings.\n",

            "**Problem Statement:**\n",
            "Current state-of-the-art differentiable search methods in MBRL, such as DTS, predominantly assume deterministic environment dynamics for their learned world models. This assumption restricts their applicability and robustness in many real-world scenarios which are inherently stochastic. There is a need for methods that can integrate rich, stochastic world models directly within such differentiable search frameworks and optimize them end-to-end.\n",

However, these models typically do not explicitly account for or adapt to the perceptual uncertainty associated with `s_{t+1}`. If `s_{t+1}` (especially its visual components) is poorly perceived, it introduces unreliable information into the learning target, potentially leading to a γ-Model that is less accurate or overly confident in its predictions, impacting the performance of agents that rely on it for planning or control.  \n",

Specifically, (1) collecting `s_{t+1}` data that is actively verified for perceptual clarity, and (2) dynamically down-weighting the influence of the bootstrapped term `µ_θ(· | s_{t+1})` when `s_{t+1}` remains perceptually uncertain, should allow the γ-Model to learn a more accurate and reliable representation of the true discounted state occupancies.

Ensembles are a proven technique for estimating epistemic uncertainty and capturing multi-modality in deep learning. By creating an ensemble of γ-models, we can leverage their individual predictive power while deriving a collective uncertainty estimate for `s_e`.

            "Paper A (\"γ-Models: Generative Temporal Difference Learning for Infinite-Horizon Prediction\") introduces γ-models capable of impressive long-horizon state prediction (`s_e`) without explicit timesteps. However, these models do not inherently output a quantifiable measure of their own confidence or uncertainty regarding these predictions. Paper B (\"Know Where You're Uncertain When Planning with Multimodal Foundation Models: A Formal Framework\") underscores the critical role of uncertainty quantification (for current perception and high-level symbolic plans) in robotics for reliability. A gap exists in equipping sophisticated world models like γ-models with the ability to explicitly quantify uncertainty in their *own future state predictions*, especially for complex visual details or in non-deterministic scenarios. Current world models often provide only point estimates or implicit distributions of future states, making it hard for agents to discern prediction reliability.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Problem Statement:**\n",
            "The efficacy of model-based reinforcement learning agents, particularly in visually rich and stochastic environments, is limited by their world models' inability to explicitly quantify the uncertainty associated with future state predictions. This means an agent cannot tell how much to trust its imagined future.\n",
            "*Condition:* We currently lack methods to extract explicit, well-calibrated predictive uncertainty directly from advanced infinite-horizon world models like γ-models concerning their generated future states (`s_e`), especially regarding the fidelity of fine-grained visual details or the likelihood of multiple distinct outcomes in non-deterministic worlds.\n",
            "*Consequence:* Without this explicit uncertainty, agents may treat all imagined futures with equal confidence, leading to suboptimal or unsafe policies, inefficient exploration (either over-exploring safe areas or under-exploring due to unexpected outcomes), and difficulty in diagnosing whether a prediction error is due to model inadequacy or inherent world stochasticity. This directly impacts the concerns highlighted in the field: preserving visual details and effectively modeling non-deterministic worlds.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Motivation:**\n",
            "Paper A's γ-models provide a powerful framework for efficient, infinite-horizon prediction by effectively amortizing multi-step rollouts into a single generative step. However, they do not explicitly output how confident the model is about any specific predicted future state `s_e`. While generative models can sample, distinguishing inherent randomness (aleatoric uncertainty) from model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or representing multi-modal futures clearly is not a direct output. Paper B demonstrates the value of disentangled uncertainty (perception of current state, validation of symbolic plans) for robust robotic systems, but its techniques are not directly applicable to quantifying the uncertainty of a world model's internal predictions of future, potentially low-level or visual, states.\n",
            "\n",
            "The inspiration for this research comes from the widespread success of ensemble methods in deep learning for quantifying epistemic uncertainty and capturing multi-modal outputs. By constructing an ensemble of γ-models, we hypothesize that we can derive a robust measure of predictive uncertainty. The mean prediction across the ensemble can represent the most likely future, while the variance (or other measures of disagreement) among ensemble members' predictions for `s_e` can serve as an explicit uncertainty signal `u_e`. This `u_e` would allow an agent to \"know when its world model is uncertain\" about the futures it imagines. Such a mechanism would be superior to a single γ-model because it explicitly models a distribution over predictions, enabling quantification of disagreement, which is a strong correlate of model uncertainty and can expose different possible future modes.\n",

            "An ensemble of γ-models, trained using generative temporal difference learning, will produce a quantifiable and well-calibrated measure of predictive uncertainty (`u_e`) for its generated infinite-horizon future states (`s_e`). Agents that leverage this uncertainty information (e.g., for risk-sensitive planning, adjusting value estimates, or guiding exploration) will demonstrate improved asymptotic performance, robustness to environmental stochasticity, and/or sample efficiency in visually complex and potentially non-deterministic environments compared to agents relying on a single γ-model or world models without explicit uncertainty quantification.\n",

Furthermore, accurately modeling and robustly predicting multiple, potentially interacting, sources of stochasticity over extended future horizons remains a significant challenge. This often leads to model inaccuracies that either get exploited by the agent (the \"cheating\" problem in Paper A) or cause poor planning performance in the true environment.\n",

Its MDN-RNN (M-model) handled basic stochasticity but has inherent capacity limitations for complex, long-term dynamics. Paper B (\"Learning Latent Dynamics for Planning from Pixels\") introduced the highly effective RSSM, which combines deterministic and stochastic pathways for robust latent dynamics modeling, and proposed \"latent overshooting\" to enhance multi-step predictive accuracy. However, its reliance on a full observation model for pixel reconstruction can be computationally burdensome and may not optimally focus representation learning; its latent space is also monolithic.\n",

            "**Observed Phenomenon**  \n",
            "Current state-of-the-art latent dynamics models, such as the Recurrent State Space Model (RSSM) used in PlaNet (\"Learning Latent Dynamics for Planning from Pixels\"), typically model the stochastic component of the latent state (`s_t`) with a unimodal probability distribution (e.g., a single Gaussian conditioned on the deterministic hidden state `h_t`). While effective in many scenarios, this unimodal assumption may not adequately capture the dynamics of environments where a given situation can lead to several *distinct, qualitatively different, and discrete* stochastic outcomes. This can result in the model \"averaging\" over these divergent futures or struggling to represent them faithfully in its compact latent space.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Problem Statement:**\n",
            "The primary problem is the limited capacity of existing latent world models like RSSM to explicitly represent and plan over multi-modal stochastic transitions in environments with discretely branching futures. This limitation hinders their ability to make accurate long-term predictions and optimal plans in scenarios where the environment's evolution from a similar history (`h_t`) can diverge into a few distinct possibilities, each with potentially different visual characteristics and reward consequences.\n",
            "\n",
            "*Condition:* We don’t yet have robust mechanisms within compact latent state models like RSSMs to explicitly learn and sample from multiple discrete stochastic future branches conditioned on the deterministic part of the state.  \n",
            "*Consequence:* If the model cannot clearly represent these distinct branches, the planner may make suboptimal decisions due to an \"averaged\" or incomplete understanding of potential outcomes. This is particularly detrimental when subtle cues differentiate critical, high-consequence branches, or when the agent needs to reason about the specific probabilities and characteristics of each potential path. This can lead to the agent failing to avoid risks or capitalize on opportunities tied to specific stochastic events.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Motivation:**\n",
            "PlaNet (Paper B: \"Learning Latent Dynamics for Planning from Pixels\") demonstrated significant success by learning an RSSM with separate deterministic (`h_t`) and stochastic (`s_t`) latent state components, enabling effective planning (CEM) in latent space. However, its stochastic transition `s_t ~ p(s_t | h_t)` is typically a unimodal Gaussian.\n",
            "\n",
            "The original \"World Models\" paper (Paper A) introduced the use of a Mixture Density Network (MDN) as part of its M-model to predict the next latent state `z_{t+1}` as a mixture of Gaussians. This explicitly captured multi-modal future possibilities and allowed for a \"temperature\" (`τ`) parameter to control the randomness and exploitability of the dreamed environment. This was crucial for handling non-deterministic worlds and preventing the agent from \"cheating\" the world model.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our proposed method is inspired by merging these strengths: we aim to extend PlaNet's RSSM architecture by incorporating the MDN's capability for modeling multi-modal distributions directly into the stochastic state transition `p(s_t | h_t)`. This would allow the RSSM to learn distinct \"types\" or \"modes\" of stochastic evolution from a given deterministic context `h_t`. This richer representation of uncertainty is expected to enhance the planner's ability to evaluate action sequences across these discrete branches. Furthermore, adapting Paper A's temperature concept to control the sampling from these learned modes during planning could provide better control over exploration versus exploitation within the imagined rollouts and improve robustness against model inaccuracies. This addresses one of the core concerns in world model RL: \"How do you learn and sample from non-deterministic worlds, where same state can lead to many different future states?\"\n",

            "Augmenting the stochastic state transition `p(s_t | h_t)` in an RSSM with a Mixture Density Network (MDN) output will enable the model to learn more accurate representations of environments characterized by discretely branching stochastic dynamics. Consequently, a planner utilizing this RSSM-MDN, especially when coupled with temperature-controlled sampling of the mixture modes, will achieve higher performance and sample efficiency compared to a standard RSSM with a unimodal Gaussian stochastic component in such environments.\n",

            "**Concrete Example:**\n",
            "Consider the \"Simplified VizDoom Branching\" environment. An enemy can fire either a (1) fast, straight projectile or (2) a slower, slightly homing projectile. The enemy has a brief \"charge-up\" animation that subtly differs for each attack type.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Baseline (PlaNet with unimodal `s_t`):** Given the deterministic history `h_t` (enemy seen, charge-up animation started), the unimodal `s_t` might represent an \"average\" projectile or be very noisy if the visual cues are ambiguous. The CEM planner's rollouts might struggle to differentiate the two attack types accurately, leading to a generic evasive action that is suboptimal for one or both types.\n",
            "*   **Proposed (PlaNet-RSSM-MDN with `K=2`):**\n",
            "    *   When `h_t` captures the enemy's charge-up, the MDN head for `p(s_t|h_t)` would ideally learn two modes:\n",
            "        *   Mode 1: `(π_1, μ_1, σ²_1)` corresponding to the latent state `s_t` that, when decoded, predicts the visual evolution and future trajectory of the fast projectile.\n",
            "        *   Mode 2: `(π_2, μ_2, σ²_2)` corresponding to the slow, homing projectile.\n",
            "    *   The mixture weights `π_1, π_2` might reflect the model's belief in each attack type based on the subtle cues in `h_t`.\n",
            "    *   During CEM planning:\n",
            "        *   If temperature `τ` is low, the planner will preferentially sample `s_t` from the mode deemed more likely by `h_t` (due to `π'_k` being sharpened). The agent can then plan a specific counter-maneuver.\n",
            "        *   If `τ` is high, the planner explores both possibilities (fast vs. slow projectile) more evenly, potentially finding a more robust (but perhaps less optimal for a specific type) evasive action, or identifying actions that are good regardless of type.\n",
            "    *   This allows the agent to potentially learn distinct reactions tailored to the predicted projectile type, leading to better survival rates than a generic policy. The visual details from the charge-up animation, if critical, are more likely to be captured and utilized by `h_t` to inform the MDN's mode selection for `s_t`, because the observation model `p(o_t|h_t,s_t)` will penalize incorrect visual predictions arising from the wrong mode.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations**\n",
            "*   **Risk 1 – Mode Collapse or Non-Identifiability:** The MDN might not learn distinct, meaningful modes. For instance, one mixture component might dominate, or the learned modes might not clearly correspond to the true discrete branches in the environment's dynamics.\n",
            "    *   *Fallback:* Ensure the KL-weighting in the loss (e.g., `β` from PlaNet) is appropriate. An overly strong KL penalty might suppress multi-modality. If necessary, explore adding a small auxiliary loss to encourage mode separation or diversity, although this is often not needed if the reconstruction/reward signals tied to different modes are sufficiently strong. Careful initialization of mixture component parameters. Prioritize environments where the discrete branches have clearly distinguishable consequences.\n",
            "*   **Risk 2 – Increased Training Complexity and Instability:** The KL divergence `KL[q(s_t|h_t,o_t) || p_{MDN}(s_t|h_t)]` is more complex than Gaussian-Gaussian KL. This could lead to numerical instability or make optimization harder.\n",
            "    *   *Fallback:* Implement robust numerical computation for the KL term. Start with a small number of mixture components (`K`). Monitor gradients and learning dynamics closely. Adjust learning rates or optimizer parameters if instability is observed. Ensure the posterior `q` is well-behaved.\n",
            "*   **Risk 3 – Difficulty in Tuning Temperature `τ`:** The temperature `τ` for planning might become another sensitive hyperparameter that is difficult to tune, or its optimal value might vary significantly across tasks or even within a task.\n",
            "    *   *Fallback:* Begin experiments with a fixed `τ=1.0` (no temperature scaling). If the multi-modal modeling itself shows benefits, then investigate `τ`. Evaluate sensitivity across a range of `τ` values. Consider adaptive `τ` schedules (e.g., annealing) or simpler heuristics for mode selection during planning (e.g., always explore the N most likely modes in addition to the single most likely).\n",

            "Stochastic-DTS: Enhancing Differentiable Tree Search with Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models for Non-Deterministic EnvironmentsObserved PhenomenonModel-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) agents, even those with sophisticated planning mechanisms like Differentiable Tree Search (DTS), often struggle in non-deterministic environments. Their performance can degrade due to the compounding errors from world model inaccuracies and an inability to effectively represent, predict, and plan under true environmental stochasticity. While DTS (Mittal & Lee, \"Differentiable Tree Search in Latent State Space\") excels by jointly optimizing a deterministic world model with search, it is explicitly limited to deterministic settings.\n",
            "Problem Statement\n",
            "Current state-of-the-art differentiable search methods in MBRL, such as DTS, predominantly assume deterministic environment dynamics for their learned world models. This assumption restricts their applicability and robustness in many real-world scenarios which are inherently stochastic. There is a need for methods that can integrate rich, stochastic world models directly within such differentiable search frameworks and optimize them end-to-end.*   *Condition:* We don’t yet have a robust framework that allows for the joint, end-to-end optimization of an explicitly *stochastic* (e.g., transformer-based) world model and a *differentiable tree search* algorithm for decision-making in non-deterministic environments.*   *Consequence:* The significant advantages of differentiable search and planning (e.g., improved sample efficiency and generalization through co-adaptation of model and search) are not fully realized in environments with inherent unpredictability, limiting progress towards more general and capable AI agents.\n",
            "Motivation\n",
            "Existing MBRL approaches face challenges:1.  Deterministic World Models in Stochastic Environments: Using a deterministic model (as in original DTS) in a stochastic world leads to a model mismatch, where the model might learn an \"average\" transition or ignore low-probability, high-impact events, leading to suboptimal or unsafe policies.2.  Separately Trained Stochastic Models: Training a stochastic world model independently and then using it with a planner (e.g., MCTS) does not benefit from the joint optimization that DTS leverages to make the world model more useful *for the specific search algorithm* and vice-versa. Errors in the standalone model directly propagate and compound during planning.3.  Model-Free Methods: Often require vast amounts of data to implicitly learn about stochasticity.The proposed \"Stochastic-DTS\" (S-DTS) method is inspired by the need to address these limitations. By extending DTS's architecture with a stochastic transition model based on insights from \"STORM: Efficient Stochastic Transformer based World Models for Reinforcement Learning\" (Paper A, assumed to provide an efficient way to model stochastic transitions using transformers), we aim to:*   Enable the world model to explicitly represent and predict a *distribution* over possible next states, rather than a single outcome. Transformers are powerful sequence models well-suited for capturing complex dynamics in latent space.*   Retain DTS's core strength of jointly optimizing the world model components (including the new stochastic transition model) with the differentiable search mechanism. This allows the search to learn to account for model inaccuracies and the model to become more attuned to the needs of the search process, even under uncertainty.*   The \"efficient\" nature of the assumed STORM transformer is key to ensuring the computational feasibility of incorporating a potentially complex stochastic model into the search loop.S-DTS is motivated by the idea that a search algorithm co-adapted with a world model that explicitly acknowledges and quantifies stochasticity will make more robust and effective decisions in unpredictable environments.\n",
            "Hypothesis\n",
            "Incorporating an efficient stochastic transformer-based transition model (inspired by STORM) into the Differentiable Tree Search (DTS) framework, and jointly optimizing all components end-to-end, will enable the agent to achieve significantly superior performance, sample efficiency, and generalization in complex, non-deterministic reinforcement learning environments compared to (a) the original DTS with a deterministic world model, (b) model-free baselines, and (c) model-based methods that use separately trained stochastic world models.\n",
            "Proposed Method\n",
            "The S-DTS method modifies and extends the Differentiable Tree Search (DTS) architecture. The core components are:1.  Learnable Submodules (as in DTS, with one key change):    *   Encoder Module (`E_θ`): Encodes an actual state `s_t` into a latent state representation `h_t`. `h_t = E_θ(s_t)`.    *   Stochastic Transition Module (`T_θ_STORM`): This module *replaces* DTS's deterministic transition module. It takes the current latent state `h_t` and action `a_t` as input and outputs the parameters of a probability distribution over the next latent state `h_{t+1}`. For example, for continuous latent states, it might output the mean and log-variance of a Gaussian distribution: `μ_{t+1}, σ_{t+1} = T_θ_STORM(h_t, a_t)`. A transformer architecture (inspired by STORM's efficiency and stochastic modeling capabilities) will be used for `T_θ_STORM`.    *   Reward Module (`R_θ`): Predicts the reward `r_t` for a transition: `r_t = R_θ(h_t, a_t)`.    *   Value Module (`V_θ`): Approximates the state value `V(h_t)`.2.  Online Search in Latent Space (adapted from DTS):    *   Expansion Phase: DTS employs a best-first search strategy, guided by a learned stochastic tree expansion policy `π_θ(n_t|τ_t)` that selects a candidate node `N*` for expansion from the open set `O`. When expanding `N*` with an action `a`:        *   The stochastic transition module `T_θ_STORM` is used to predict the distribution of the next latent state: `P(h_child | h_{N*}, a)`.        *   A next latent state `h_child` is *sampled* from this predicted distribution: `h_child ~ P(h_{child} | h_{N*}, a)`. If Gaussian, use reparameterization: `h_child = μ + σ * ε`, where `ε ~ N(0,I)`.        *   The new node `h_child` and associated predicted reward `R_θ(h_{N*}, a)` are added to the search tree.    *   Backup Phase: Q-values and node values are recursively computed using Bellman updates as in DTS. For a node `N` and action `a_i`, `Q(N, a_i) = R_θ(h_N, a_i) + γV(sampled\\_h_{child_i})`. The value `V(N)` is `max_a Q(N,a)` for internal nodes or `V_θ(h_N)` for leaf nodes.3.  Training and Loss Functions (extending DTS):    The entire S-DTS network, including all submodules and the search process, is trained end-to-end.    *   Primary RL Loss (`L_Q`): Mean Squared Error between the Q-values output by the search for the root state-action `Q_θ(s, a|τ)` and a target Q-value (e.g., from expert trajectories in an offline RL setup, or bootstrapped targets).    *   Conservative Q-Learning Loss (`L_D`): If training in an offline RL setting (as in DTS paper), `L_D` from CQL is used to mitigate overestimation of OOD actions.    *   Auxiliary Losses for World Model Consistency:        *   Transition Model Loss (`L_T_θ_STORM`): Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) of the target encoded next state `h_{t+1_target} = E_θ(s_{t+1_actual})` given the distribution predicted by `T_θ_STORM(E_θ(s_t), a_t)`. This loss trains the stochastic transition model to make accurate distributional predictions.        *   Reward Model Loss (`L_R_θ`): MSE between predicted reward `R_θ(h_t, a_t)` and actual reward `r_t`.    *   The overall loss is a weighted sum: `L = λ_Q L_Q + λ_D L_D + λ_T L_T_θ_STORM + λ_R L_R_θ`.    *   The stochastic tree expansion policy `π_θ` is optimized using REINFORCE with the telescoping sum trick for variance reduction, as described in DTS, to maximize the expected (negative) `L_Q`.\n",
            "Proposed Experiment Outline\n",
            "1.  Datasets/Environments:    *   Modified Grid Worlds: Custom 2D grid worlds with configurable levels of stochasticity in transitions (e.g., an action 'move_north' has an 80% chance of success, 10% chance of moving east 'slip_east', 10% staying put 'sticky_action').    *   Stochastic Procgen: Select a subset of Procgen games (e.g., ones used in DTS like 'climber', 'coinrun') and introduce stochastic elements. For instance:        *   Enemy movement patterns become probabilistic.        *   Effectiveness of certain actions (e.g., jumps) might have a random component.        *   Item spawn locations or effects become probabilistic.    *   Collect offline datasets of expert trajectories for these environments, similar to the DTS paper's methodology, or perform online training.2.  Models for Comparison:    *   S-DTS (Proposed): The method described above.    *   DTS-Deterministic (Baseline 1): The original DTS from Paper B, using a deterministic MLP for the transition module.    *   Model-Free RL (Baseline 2): A strong model-free algorithm suitable for the environment type and data setting (e.g., CQL if offline on Procgen, or Rainbow DQN for online grid worlds).    *   MBRL with Separately Trained Stochastic World Model (Baseline 3):        *   Train a standalone stochastic transformer world model (similar to `T_θ_STORM` but trained only on `L_T_θ_STORM` and `L_R_θ` from collected data).        *   Use this pre-trained model with a planner like MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search), using the learned value function `V_θ` as a heuristic if applicable.    *   S-DTS (Ablation - No Joint WM Opt.): The proposed S-DTS, but the stochastic transition model `T_θ_STORM` is pre-trained and its weights are frozen during the search optimization phase (or only updated via its NLL loss, not through gradients from `L_Q`). This tests the impact of full joint optimization.3.  Metrics:    *   Primary:        *   Average cumulative reward per episode.        *   Task success rate (if applicable, e.g., reaching goal in grid world).    *   Secondary:        *   Sample efficiency: Performance improvement as a function of training interactions/data.        *   Generalization: Performance on unseen levels or variations in stochasticity parameters.        *   Training time / inference time.        *   World model prediction accuracy (e.g., NLL on a held-out test set for `T_θ_STORM`).4.  Experimental Steps:    1.  Implement common modules: `E_θ`, `R_θ`, `V_θ` based on DTS.    2.  Implement `T_θ_STORM` using an efficient transformer architecture (e.g., with linear attention if computationally demanding) outputting parameters for a chosen distribution (e.g., Gaussian).    3.  Integrate `T_θ_STORM` into the DTS search logic, including sampling for expansion and the NLL loss `L_T_θ_STORM`.    4.  Implement all baseline models.    5.  Train all models on the selected stochastic environments using the collected datasets (offline) or online interaction. Ensure fair comparison of hyperparameters and computational budgets.    6.  Evaluate all trained models based on the primary and secondary metrics.    7.  Analyze results, particularly comparing performance in environments with varying degrees of stochasticity.    *(No LLM prompting is directly involved in this specific experimental setup for model training or execution.)*5.  Success Criteria:    *   Primary: S-DTS significantly outperforms DTS-Deterministic and other baselines on average reward/success rate in stochastic environments.    *   Secondary: S-DTS demonstrates better sample efficiency or generalization to new stochastic conditions. The ablation study shows that joint optimization provides benefits over separate training.\n",
            "Concrete Example\n",
            "Consider a \"slippery ice\" grid world. The agent is at `(x,y)` and wants to reach a goal.*   Action: `move_north`.*   Environment Stochasticity:    *   70% chance: move to `(x, y+1)` (intended).    *   20% chance: slip, move to `(x+1, y+1)` (slip right).    *   10% chance: slip, move to `(x-1, y+1)` (slip left).*   DTS-Deterministic (Baseline): Its transition model might learn an \"average\" outcome, or one of the most frequent ones, e.g., always predict `(x, y+1)`. During search, it would plan based on this deterministic prediction, potentially underestimating risks near edges or hazards if slips are ignored.*   S-DTS (Proposed):    *   `T_θ_STORM(h_current, 'move_north')` would predict a distribution over next latent states corresponding to `(x,y+1)`, `(x+1,y+1)`, and `(x-1,y+1)` with learned probabilities.    *   During one search expansion trial, S-DTS might sample `h_child` corresponding to `(x,y+1)`. In another trial (or another part of training/evaluation), it might sample `h_child` corresponding to a slip, e.g., `(x+1,y+1)`.    *   The `Value Module (V_θ)` and overall Q-values learned through DTS's search and backup will average over these experienced stochastic outcomes.    *   Behavioral Difference: S-DTS, having modeled the possibility of slipping, might choose a path that is slightly longer but further away from hazards, if slipping near a hazard has a high negative consequence. DTS-Deterministic might take the nominally shortest path, oblivious to the slip risk, and perform worse on average.\n",
            "Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations\n",
            "& Mitigations*   Risk 1 – Training Instability: The interplay of REINFORCE for the search policy `π_θ` and learning the stochastic transition model `T_θ_STORM` (whose outputs are sampled) could lead to high variance and instability.    *   Fallback: Leverage DTS's existing variance reduction (telescoping sum). Implement careful learning rate schedules, gradient clipping. Consider entropy regularization for both `π_θ` and the output distribution of `T_θ_STORM` to encourage exploration and prevent premature collapse. Ensure robust reparameterization for `T_θ_STORM` outputs.*   Risk 2 – Computational Overhead: Transformer models can be computationally expensive, potentially slowing down the search trials within DTS.    *   Fallback: Utilize an \"efficient\" transformer architecture as implied by the STORM paper (e.g., linear attention, performers, sparse transformers). Limit the size/depth of the transformer if necessary. Control the number of search trials (`T` in DTS) to balance planning quality and speed. Profile code to identify bottlenecks.*   Risk 3 – Difficulty in Learning Accurate Stochastic Dynamics: The `T_θ_STORM` might struggle to learn an accurate predictive distribution, especially with limited data or highly complex stochasticity.    *   Fallback: Increase the weight of `L_T_θ_STORM` loss. Explore curriculum learning, starting with simpler stochastic environments. Ensure the latent space `h` (from `E_θ`) is well-structured (DTS uses Tanh normalization and consistency losses, which helps). Consider simpler distributional families for initial experiments.*   Risk 4 – Credit Assignment for World Model: Ensuring that the `T_θ_STORM` parameters are effectively updated both by its direct NLL loss and by the overall RL objective `L_Q` propagated through sampled transitions.    *   Fallback: Primarily rely on reparameterization for continuous stochasticity (e.g., Gaussian outputs from `T_θ_STORM`) to ensure direct gradient flow from `L_Q`. For discrete stochasticity, use Gumbel-Softmax if applicable. The NLL loss provides a strong, direct signal. Analyze gradients to ensure they are flowing correctly.\n",

              "'so one important thing I noticed is: The write up treats STORM’s world model as a drop-in replacement for DTS’s deterministic MLP. But STORM is trained with a variational inference objective on 1-step transitions, while DTS needs stable multi-step rollouts for planning. storm cannot be used directly as a plug and play module In storm, training relies on a learned inference network to approximate the posterior for variational learning. This is never mentioned in the writeup. Without inference guidance, the latent dynamics may be undertrained. You cannot compute a valid KL divergence loss without the inference model. the system misses out listing the inference network in the setup section also, I was not able to fully understand how CQL is going to be used here. It is a baseline but I am not sure if that is directly comparable. In stochastic trees, value backups are not just max over children; you need to marginalize over sampled paths (like expected backups or softmax Bellman). you should have some backup mechanism for stochastic branches. (edited)  on an overall sense, the idea does strike well to me. i am doubtful about the sample efficiency part but i think this can produce a nice world model. I am going to continue with this later and add some my ideas as well, I think there are some tricks that can help you here. For novelty and significance of this idea on a scale of 1-4? if works out, this is a good 2.5 I think, I heavily doubt sample efficiency but this can be really helpful for long horizon sensitive applications. if this is indeed sample efficient too - its 3.5 and a sure shot ICLR kinda work. but I doubt it right now, if you can show its application in sensitive control domains like robotic surgeon for instance, it will be super super impactful. this does makes sense though, you might need to do some major changes in the world model as well though but I think they can be handled with a combination of losses.'"

I will add a more specific mitigation strategy suggested by the reviewer: \"Compare telescoping-sum alone vs. telescoping + per-node baselines\" to find the most effective variance reduction technique.\\n\\n*   **Quote:** \"Planner latency – even linear-attention Transformers inside hundreds of tree expansions can be a wall-clock killer.\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The computational cost concern needs to be more central to the experimental design and model definition.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** In the \"Proposed Method\", I will be more specific about using an efficient transformer variant (e.g., Performer) with a small layer count, citing STORM\\'s ablation studies. In the \"Proposed Experiment Outline\", I will elevate \"wall-clock time\" to a primary metric and add a specific experiment suggested by the reviewer: \"Grid-search over {tree trials ∈ [1, 32]} × {Transformer depth ∈ [2, 8]}. Plot reward vs. wall-clock.\"\\n\\n*   **Quote:** \"Evaluation subtlety – need tasks where true uncertainty, not partial observability, is the bottleneck.\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The experimental environments need to be designed to specifically test against stochasticity.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** I will refine the description of the \"Stochastic Procgen\" environment to emphasize that the modifications introduce true transition stochasticity (e.g., probabilistic action outcomes) rather than just hiding state information.\\n\\n*   **Quote:** \"Does joint training really calibrate uncertainty? Experiment: Track KL-divergence between predicted transition distribution and empirical next-state histogram over training epochs.\" and other desrisking experiments.\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The experiment section is good but can be made more rigorous with specific, targeted experiments to probe the model\\'s behavior and validate key claims.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** I will add a new subsection to the experiment outline called \"Desrisking Experiments and In-depth Analysis\". This section will include the specific experiments suggested: (1) Tracking KL-divergence for uncertainty calibration, (2) Testing on rare catastrophic outcomes using CVaR, and (3) Testing generalization to unseen levels of stochasticity.\\n\\n### Evaluator 2 Feedback Analysis\\n\\n*   **Quote:** \"The write up treats STORM’s world model as a drop-in replacement... STORM is trained with a variational inference objective on 1-step transitions... In storm, training relies on a learned inference network... This is never mentioned... You cannot compute a valid KL divergence loss without the inference model.\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** This is a major technical flaw in my original proposal. The entire world model training process was oversimplified and incorrect. I need to replace my simplistic NLL loss with the full variational objective from STORM.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** I will overhaul the \"Proposed Method\" and \"Loss Functions\" sections. I will explicitly define the world model components based on **STORM (Section 3.1, Figure 2)**, including:\\n    1.  An **Image Encoder** (`q_φ(z_t|o_t)`) that outputs a posterior distribution.\\n    2.  A **Sequence Model** (`f_φ`) that produces a hidden state `h_t`.\\n    3.  A **Dynamics Predictor** (`g_φ`) that uses `h_t` to predict a *prior* distribution over the next latent state.\\n    4.  The Agent\\'s state will be defined as `s_t = [z_t, h_t]`, as in STORM.\\n    5.  The world model loss will be a combination of reconstruction, reward, and the two KL-divergence losses (**Equations 5a and 5b from STORM**): `L_dyn` and `L_rep`. This is a critical fix.\\n\\n*   **Quote:** \"In stochastic trees, value backups are not just max over children; you need to marginalize over sampled paths (like expected backups or softmax Bellman).\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** My description of the backup phase was unclear about how it handles stochastic transitions.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** I will clarify the \"Backup Phase\" description. While the backup *rule* (`V(N) = max_a Q(N,a)`) is formally the same as in DTS, I will explain that the end-to-end optimization over many *sampled* rollouts forces the value function `V_θ` to learn an *implicit expectation* over the stochastic outcomes. The gradient signal from the final `L_Q` loss, propagated through the stochastically constructed graph, adjusts the value network to be robust to the modeled uncertainty. This is a core feature of the differentiable search framework that needs better explanation.\\n\\n*   **Quote:** \"I was not able to fully understand how CQL is going to be used here.\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The role of the CQL loss (`L_D`) needs to be clarified.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** In the \"Training and Loss Functions\" section, I will clarify that `L_D` is used as an auxiliary regularization term—identical to its use in the original DTS paper—when training in an offline RL setting, to prevent the policy from exploiting out-of-distribution actions.\\n\\n### Evaluator 3 Feedback Analysis\\n\\n*   **Quote:** \"How exactly do gradients flow through the sampled transitions during tree expansion? The reparameterization trick works for continuous distributions, but what about discrete stochastic environments?\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** I need to specify the mechanism for differentiable sampling in discrete domains.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** I will add a sentence in the \"Online Search in Latent Space\" section stating that for discrete stochasticity, we will use the **Gumbel-Softmax trick**, which provides a differentiable approximation to sampling from a categorical distribution.\\n\\n*   **Quote:** \"Have you considered simpler baselines like DTS with ensemble models or uncertainty quantification rather than full stochastic modeling?\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The set of baselines could be stronger and include methods that also account for uncertainty but in a different way.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** This is an excellent suggestion. I will add a new baseline to the \"Models for Comparison\" section: **\"DTS + Ensembles\"**. This involves training an ensemble of `k` deterministic transition models. During search, one model is randomly selected for each expansion step. This provides a strong, alternative way to handle uncertainty.\\n\\n*   **Quote:** \"What are the computational complexity comparisons between S-DTS and the baselines, particularly in terms of wall-clock time?\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The importance of wall-clock time as a key metric needs to be reflected in the experimental plan.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** Corroborating Evaluator 1\\'s feedback, I will move \"wall-clock time\" to be a primary evaluation metric in the \"Metrics\" subsection.\\n\\n*   **Quote:** \"How will you handle environments where the stochasticity is not easily captured by simple parametric distributions?\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** I need to acknowledge this limitation in the \"Potential Pitfalls\".\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** I will add a new risk, \"Model Misspecification,\" acknowledging that our assumed parametric distributions might not match complex real-world stochasticity. The mitigation will be to start with environments where this assumption holds and suggest that future work could explore more flexible distributional models like normalizing flows.\\n\\n<REVISED IDEA>\\n\\n## Generated Research Idea\\n\\n**Title:** S-DTS: Jointly Optimizing Differentiable Tree Search and Stochastic World Models\\n\\n**Observed Phenomenon**\\nModel-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) agents with sophisticated planning, such as Differentiable Tree Search (DTS), excel by co-adapting their world model and search algorithm. However, their reliance on deterministic world models makes them brittle in non-deterministic environments. They either learn an \"average\" world dynamic, ignoring rare but critical events, or their performance degrades due to compounding prediction errors, a problem observed even in state-of-the-art methods.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nCurrent differentiable search methods in MBRL predominantly assume deterministic environment dynamics. This core assumption severely limits their applicability and robustness in real-world scenarios, from robotics to resource management, which are inherently stochastic. There is a critical need for a framework that can integrate a rich, explicitly stochastic world model directly within a differentiable search process and optimize the entire system end-to-end.\\n*Condition:* We don’t yet have a method that allows for the joint, end-to-end optimization of an explicitly *stochastic* transformer-based world model and a *differentiable tree search* algorithm.\\n*Consequence:* The significant benefits of differentiable planning (co-adaptation of model and search for improved sample efficiency and generalization) remain unrealized in non-deterministic environments. This hampers progress toward AI agents that can plan robustly and safely in the face of uncertainty.\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\nExisting approaches fall short in stochastic environments:\\n1.  **DTS with Deterministic Models:** The original DTS, while powerful, is fundamentally mismatched with stochastic worlds. It plans based on point-estimates of the future, leading to policies that can be blind to risk and perform poorly on average.\\n2.  **Separately Trained Stochastic Models:** Using a pre-trained stochastic world model with a planner like MCTS breaks the end-to-end differentiability. The model is not optimized to be *plannable* for the specific search algorithm, and the planner cannot adapt to the model\\'s particular failure modes.\\n3.  **Model-Free Methods:** Often require prohibitive amounts of data to implicitly learn policies that are robust to environmental variance.\\n\\nInspired by these gaps, S-DTS integrates the architectural principles of **STORM**, an efficient stochastic transformer-based world model, into the **DTS** framework. The key motivation is that by making the world model\\'s uncertainty explicit and propagating gradients through the entire search process, the agent can learn not just *what* might happen, but also *how likely* different outcomes are, and adapt its plan accordingly. The model learns dynamics that are useful for search, and the search learns to account for the model\\'s specific predictive uncertainties, leading to more robust decision-making.\\n\\n**Hypothesis**\\nIncorporating a stochastic transformer-based world model (following STORM\\'s variational structure) into the Differentiable Tree Search (DTS) framework, and jointly optimizing all components end-to-end, will enable an agent to achieve significantly superior performance, risk-aware behavior, and generalization in complex, non-deterministic environments compared to (a) the original DTS, (b) model-free baselines, and (c) methods using separately trained world models or ensembles.\\n\\n**Proposed Method:**\\nS-DTS modifies the DTS architecture by replacing its deterministic transition function with a full stochastic world model based on STORM, ensuring end-to-end differentiability.\\n\\n1.  **Learnable Submodules (Adapting STORM\\'s structure):**\\n    *   **Encoder (`q_φ(z_t|o_t)`):** A CNN that encodes an observation `o_t` into a posterior distribution over latent states `Z_t`. A sample `z_t ~ Z_t` is drawn.\\n    *   **Sequence Model (`f_φ`):** An efficient Transformer (e.g., Performer, small layer count) that acts as a recurrent core. It takes the previous hidden state and the embedding of the previous latent state `z_{t-1}` and action `a_{t-1}` to produce the current deterministic hidden state `h_t`.\\n    *   **Dynamics Predictor (`g_φ`):** An MLP head that uses `h_t` to predict the *prior* distribution over the next latent state, `p(z_{t+1}|h_t)`.\\n    *   **Reward/Continuation/Decoder Predictors (`g_φ`):** MLPs that predict reward, continuation flags, and reconstruct the observation from latent states, as in STORM.\\n    *   **Agent State:** The full state for planning is the concatenation `s_t = [z_t, h_t]`, combining the stochastic sample and the deterministic context.\\n\\n2.  **Online Search in Latent Space (Adapted from DTS):**\\n    *   **Expansion Phase:** S-DTS follows DTS\\'s best-first search, guided by a learned stochastic tree expansion policy `π_θ`. When expanding a node `N*` (with state `s_{N*} = [z_{N*}, h_{N*}]`) with an action `a`:\\n        *   The sequence model is used to get the prior distribution over the next latent state: `P(z_child | h_{N*})`.\\n        *   A next latent state `z_child` is **sampled** from this distribution. For continuous latent spaces (Gaussian), the reparameterization trick is used. For discrete spaces (Categorical), the **Gumbel-Softmax trick** is used to maintain differentiability.\\n        *   The next hidden state `h_child` is computed, and the new agent state `s_child = [z_child, h_child]` forms the new node in the tree.\\n    *   **Backup Phase:** The backup mechanism is formally identical to DTS: `Q(N, a) = R_θ(h_N, a) + γV(s_child)` and `V(N) = max_a Q(N,a)`. Crucially, because `s_child` is a result of stochastic sampling, the end-to-end training of the value networks (`V_θ`) and Q-values over many such sampled rollouts forces them to learn an **implicit expectation** over the stochastic transitions, making them robust to the modeled uncertainty.\\n\\n3.  **Training and Loss Functions (Combining DTS and STORM):**\\n    The entire S-DTS network is trained end-to-end.\\n    *   **Primary RL Loss (`L_Q`):** MSE between the search-derived Q-value `Q_θ(s, a|τ)` and a target Q-value, as in DTS.\\n    *   **Conservative Regularization (`L_D`):** When training offline, the CQL loss from the DTS paper is added to regularize out-of-distribution actions.\\n    *   **World Model Loss (from STORM):**\\n        *   Reconstruction Loss `L_rec`, Reward Loss `L_rew`, Continuation Loss `L_con`.\\n        *   **Dynamics Loss (`L_dyn`):** `KL[sg(posterior) || prior]`. Trains the dynamics predictor.\\n        *   **Representation Loss (`L_rep`):** `KL[posterior || sg(prior)]`. Regularizes the encoder.\\n        *   These replace the simple NLL loss and correctly implement the variational objective as per **STORM, Eq. 5**.\\n    *   The overall loss is a weighted sum of these components. The tree expansion policy `π_θ` is trained with REINFORCE and the telescoping sum trick, as in DTS.\\n\\n**Proposed Experiment Outline:**\\n\\n1.  **Environments:**\\n    *   **Stochastic Grid Worlds:** Custom grid worlds with tunable transition stochasticity (e.g., \\'slippery ice\\' where actions have a probabilistic outcome).\\n    *   **Stochastic Procgen:** Modify a subset of Procgen games (\\'climber\\', \\'jumper\\') by introducing true transition stochasticity (e.g., actions have a probabilistic chance of failure or side-effects, enemy patterns are non-deterministic).\\n    *   **Data:** Collect offline expert datasets for batch RL experiments, following the DTS methodology.\\n\\n2.  **Models for Comparison:**\\n    *   **S-DTS (Proposed):** The full method described above.\\n    *   **DTS-Deterministic (Baseline 1):** The original DTS from Paper 2.\\n    *   **Model-Free RL (Baseline 2):** A strong baseline like CQL for the offline setting.\\n    *   **MBRL with Separately Trained WM (Baseline 3):** Train the stochastic world model from S-DTS on its own losses, then freeze it and use it with MCTS.\\n    *   **DTS + Ensembles (Baseline 4):** A strong new baseline. Train an ensemble of deterministic DTS transition models. During search, randomly select one model from the ensemble for each expansion step to simulate uncertainty.\\n\\n3.  **Metrics:**\\n    *   **Primary:**\\n        *   Average cumulative reward per episode.\\n        *   Task success rate.\\n        *   Wall-clock training and inference time.\\n    *   **Secondary:**\\n        *   Sample efficiency curves.\\n        *   World model prediction accuracy (NLL/KL-div on a held-out set).\\n        *   Risk-adjusted return (e.g., Conditional Value at Risk - CVaR).\\n\\n4.  **Desrisking Experiments and In-depth Analysis:**\\n    1.  **Uncertainty Calibration:** Track the KL-divergence between the model\\'s predictive prior and the encoder\\'s posterior over training to see if joint optimization improves model quality.\\n    2.  **Performance vs. Compute:** Grid-search over tree trials vs. transformer depth, plotting reward vs. wall-clock time.\\n    3.  **Risk Sensitivity:** Introduce a rare (1%) catastrophic trap state and measure CVaR to test if S-DTS learns to be more cautious than baselines.\\n    4.  **Generalization:** Train on one level of stochasticity (e.g., 20% slip) and test on others (10%, 30%, 50%) to measure robustness.\\n\\n5.  **Success Criteria:**\\n    *   **Primary:** S-DTS significantly outperforms all baselines on reward and success rate metrics in the stochastic environments.\\n    *   **Secondary:** S-DTS demonstrates superior risk-aware behavior (higher CVaR) and better generalization to unseen stochasticity levels.\\n\\n**Concrete Example:**\\nConsider a \"slippery ice\" grid world. The agent is at `(x,y)`.\\n*   **Action:** `move_north`.\\n*   **Stochasticity:** 70% chance of success `(x, y+1)`, 20% slip-right `(x+1, y)`, 10% slip-left `(x-1, y)`. A deadly chasm is at `(x+2, y)`.\\n*   **DTS-Deterministic:** Its model would predict a single outcome, likely `(x, y+1)`. It would plan a path close to the chasm, oblivious to the 20% slip risk, and would frequently fail catastrophically.\\n*   **S-DTS (Proposed):**\\n    *   Its `Dynamics Predictor` learns to output a categorical distribution over the three possible outcomes for `move_north`.\\n    *   During search, it expands nodes by sampling from this distribution. Over thousands of training steps, its value function `V_θ` sees rollouts that end in success and rollouts that end in the chasm.\\n    *   **Behavioral Difference:** The learned Q-values will correctly reflect the high negative expected value of moving near the chasm. The search will favor a slightly longer but safer path, demonstrating robust, risk-aware planning that DTS-Deterministic is incapable of.\\n\\n**Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations**\\n*   **Risk 1 – High Variance from Nested Stochasticity:** The architecture involves two nested sampling processes: (1) the REINFORCE-based sampling of which node to expand (`π_θ`), and (2) sampling the next state from the stochastic transition model (`T_θ_STORM`). This could compound variance.\\n    *   **Fallback:** Use the telescoping sum trick from DTS. Experiment with additional variance reduction techniques like per-node value baselines. Ensure robust gradient flow with reparameterization/Gumbel-Softmax.\\n*   **Risk 2 – Computational Overhead:** The transformer-based sequence model, even an efficient one, adds significant computation to each search step.\\n    *   **Fallback:** Use a lightweight efficient transformer (e.g., Performer) with a minimal number of layers (2-4, as in STORM). Limit the number of search trials. The experimental grid search will quantify this tradeoff.\\n*   **Risk 3 – Difficulty in Learning Accurate Stochastic Dynamics:** The world model might struggle to learn the true environmental probabilities from limited data.\\n    *   **Fallback:** Adjust the weight of the world model losses (`L_dyn`, `L_rep`, etc.). Use curriculum learning, starting with less stochastic environments.\\n*   **Risk 4 – Credit Assignment for World Model:** It can be difficult to ensure the world model parameters are well-trained by both the direct KL-divergence loss and the indirect RL loss propagated through the search.\\n    *   **Fallback:** Rely on reparameterization/Gumbel-Softmax for clean gradient flow from the `L_Q` loss. The direct KL losses provide a strong, stable signal. Analyze gradients to ensure they are flowing as expected.\\n*   **Risk 5 – Model Misspecification:** The assumption that a simple parametric distribution (e.g., Gaussian) can capture the true environmental stochasticity may not hold.\\n    *   **Fallback:** Begin with environments where this assumption is valid. For future work, explore more flexible output heads for the dynamics predictor, such as mixture density networks or normalizing flows, acknowledging the increase in complexity.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': '**Reflecting on Evaluator Feedback**\\n\\nI\\'m now deeply immersed in the evaluators\\' responses on \"Stochastic- DTS.\" I\\'ve meticulously dissected each critique, focusing on the core suggestions.

            "\n",
            "**Observed Phenomenon**\n",
            "Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) agents with sophisticated planning, such as Differentiable Tree Search (DTS), excel by co-adapting their world model and search algorithm. However, their reliance on deterministic world models makes them brittle in non-deterministic environments. They either learn an \"average\" world dynamic, ignoring rare but critical events, or their performance degrades due to compounding prediction errors, a problem observed even in state-of-the-art methods.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Problem Statement:**\n",
            "Current differentiable search methods in MBRL predominantly assume deterministic environment dynamics. This core assumption severely limits their applicability and robustness in real-world scenarios, from robotics to resource management, which are inherently stochastic. There is a critical need for a framework that can integrate a rich, explicitly stochastic world model directly within a differentiable search process and optimize the entire system end-to-end.\n",
            "*Condition:* We don’t yet have a method that allows for the joint, end-to-end optimization of an explicitly *stochastic* transformer-based world model and a *differentiable tree search* algorithm.\n",
            "*Consequence:* The significant benefits of differentiable planning (co-adaptation of model and search for improved sample efficiency and generalization) remain unrealized in non-deterministic environments. This hampers progress toward AI agents that can plan robustly and safely in the face of uncertainty.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Motivation:**\n",
            "Existing approaches fall short in stochastic environments:\n",
            "1.  **DTS with Deterministic Models:** The original DTS, while powerful, is fundamentally mismatched with stochastic worlds. It plans based on point-estimates of the future, leading to policies that can be blind to risk and perform poorly on average.\n",
            "2.  **Separately Trained Stochastic Models:** Using a pre-trained stochastic world model with a planner like MCTS breaks the end-to-end differentiability. The model is not optimized to be *plannable* for the specific search algorithm, and the planner cannot adapt to the model's particular failure modes.\n",
            "3.  **Model-Free Methods:** Often require prohibitive amounts of data to implicitly learn policies that are robust to environmental variance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Inspired by these gaps, S-DTS integrates the architectural principles of **STORM**, an efficient stochastic transformer-based world model, into the **DTS** framework. The key motivation is that by making the world model's uncertainty explicit and propagating gradients through the entire search process, the agent can learn not just *what* might happen, but also *how likely* different outcomes are, and adapt its plan accordingly. The model learns dynamics that are useful for search, and the search learns to account for the model's specific predictive uncertainties, leading to more robust decision-making.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Hypothesis**\n",
            "Incorporating a stochastic transformer-based world model (following STORM's variational structure) into the Differentiable Tree Search (DTS) framework, and jointly optimizing all components end-to-end, will enable an agent to achieve significantly superior performance, risk-aware behavior, and generalization in complex, non-deterministic environments compared to (a) the original DTS, (b) model-free baselines, and (c) methods using separately trained world models or ensembles.\n",

Crucially, because `s_child` is a result of stochastic sampling, the end-to-end training of the value networks (`V_θ`) and Q-values over many such sampled rollouts forces them to learn an **implicit expectation** over the stochastic transitions, making them robust to the modeled uncertainty.\n",

For each theme, I will quote the relevant feedback, identify the core issue, and outline my plan for revision.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Area 1: Flawed World Model Integration and Training**\\n\\nThis is the most critical technical flaw, pointed out by Reviewer 2. My original idea oversimplified the integration of the STORM world model.\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   **Reviewer 2:** \"The write up treats STORM’s world model as a drop-in replacement for DTS’s deterministic MLP. But STORM is trained with a variational inference objective on 1-step transitions... Without inference guidance, the latent dynamics may be undertrained. You cannot compute a valid KL divergence loss without the inference model.\"\\n    *   **Reviewer 2:** \"the system misses out listing the inference network in the setup section\"\\n    *   **Reviewer 3:** \"Unclear technical details around gradient flow through sampled transitions and transformer architecture choices\"\\n\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:**\\n    The original proposal incorrectly replaced DTS\\'s deterministic MLP with a transformer and used a simple Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) loss. This ignores the variational autoencoder (VAE) structure central to STORM. A proper integration requires:\\n    1.  An **Encoder (Inference Model)** to map observations `o_t` to a posterior latent distribution `q_ϕ(z_t|o_t)`.\\n    2.  A **Dynamics Model (Transition Prior)**, the transformer, to predict the prior latent distribution `p_ϕ(z_{t+1}|z_<=t, a_<=t)`.\\n    3.  A **Decoder** to reconstruct observations from latent states, which is essential for the VAE objective.\\n    4.  The correct **loss functions**, which are based on KL-divergences between the prior and posterior distributions (`L_dyn`, `L_rep`) and a reconstruction loss (`L_rec`), as defined in the STORM paper (Eq. 3, 4, 5).\\n\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    *   I will completely overhaul the `Proposed Method` section to detail a VAE-based world model architecture inspired by STORM.\\n    *   The \"Stochastic Transition Module\" will be renamed to the \"Variational Stochastic World Model\" to reflect its true nature.\\n    *   This module will be explicitly defined with its three components: Encoder, Transformer-based Dynamics Predictor, and Decoder. I will cite the specific architectures from STORM\\'s appendix (e.g., Tables 3, 4, 8) as a starting point.\\n    *   The `Loss functions` subsection will be rewritten. I will replace the incorrect NLL loss `L_T_θ_STORM` with the complete VAE loss from STORM: `L_rec` (reconstruction), `L_rew` (reward), `L_con` (continue), and the crucial KL-divergence terms `L_dyn` and `L_rep` (Eq. 5a, 5b in STORM). This resolves the core technical error.\\n    *   For gradient flow, I will specify using the **reparameterization trick** for continuous latents or the **Gumbel-Softmax trick** for discrete latents (which STORM uses), directly addressing Reviewer 3\\'s question.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Area 2: Incorrect Tree Backup Mechanism for Stochasticity**\\n\\nReviewer 2 identified another key error in how the search algorithm handles stochastic outcomes.\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   **Reviewer 2:** \"In stochastic trees, value backups are not just max over children; you need to marginalize over sampled paths (like expected backups or softmax Bellman).\"\\n\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:**\\n    My original proposal\\'s `Backup Phase` naively applied the `max` operator over Q-values derived from a single sampled next state. This is incorrect as it doesn\\'t account for the full distribution of possible outcomes, which is the entire point of having a stochastic model.\\n\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    *   I will revise the `Backup Phase` description in the `Proposed Method`.\\n    *   The Bellman update will be changed from a simple max over a single sample to an **expected backup**.

However, these methods typically rely on *deterministic* world models. This makes them vulnerable in non-deterministic environments, as they fail to represent or reason about the full range of possible outcomes, leading to performance degradation when faced with true environmental stochasticity or rare, high-impact events.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nState-of-the-art differentiable search methods in MBRL, such as DTS, are fundamentally limited by their assumption of deterministic environment dynamics. This assumption restricts their applicability and robustness in many real-world scenarios which are inherently stochastic. There is a critical need for a framework that can integrate a rich, stochastic world model directly within a differentiable search algorithm and optimize the entire system end-to-end.\\n\\n*   **Condition:** We lack a framework for the joint, end-to-end optimization of a variational, stochastic, sequence-based world model (like those in the VAE family) and a differentiable tree search algorithm for decision-making under uncertainty.\\n*   **Consequence:** The significant advantages of differentiable search—namely, the co-adaptation of the model and planner for improved sample efficiency and generalization—are not realized in stochastic domains. This limits progress towards agents that can plan robustly and safely in unpredictable, high-stakes environments.\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\nExisting approaches fall short in stochastic environments:\\n1.  **Deterministic Models (e.g., original DTS):** By learning a single-point estimate of the future, these models \"average out\" stochasticity. They are blind to low-probability, catastrophic events, leading to brittle and overconfident plans.\\n2.  **Separately Trained Stochastic Models:** Training a stochastic world model first and then handing it to a planner (like MCTS) breaks the end-to-end optimization loop. The model is not optimized to be *useful for the specific planner*, and any inaccuracies are compounded during rollouts without recourse.\\n3.  **High-Stakes Domains:** The need is particularly acute in domains like robotic manipulation (e.g., grasping objects with variable friction) or autonomous driving (e.g., tire slip on wet roads). In these cases, planning based on the \"average\" outcome is insufficient; the agent must reason about the entire distribution of possibilities to ensure safety and success.\\n\\nThe proposed **S-DTS** (Stochastic Differentiable Tree Search) is designed to overcome these limitations. By integrating a variational stochastic world model, inspired by **STORM**, into the **DTS** framework, we create a system where the world model explicitly represents a *distribution* over possible next states. Crucially, we retain DTS\\'s core strength: the ability to backpropagate gradients from the planning objective through the sampled rollouts to jointly optimize both the search policy and the parameters of the stochastic world model. This allows the search to learn to account for model uncertainty, and the model to produce predictions that are maximally informative for the planner.\\n\\n**Hypothesis**\\nBy integrating a variational stochastic world model into the Differentiable Tree Search (DTS) framework and jointly optimizing all components end-to-end, the resulting S-DTS agent will achieve significantly superior performance, risk-aware decision-making, and generalization in complex, non-deterministic environments compared to: (a) the original DTS with a deterministic world model, (b) DTS using a simpler ensemble-based uncertainty model, and (c) methods that use a separately trained stochastic world model with a non-differentiable planner.\\n\\n**Proposed Method:**\\nS-DTS extends the DTS architecture by replacing its deterministic transition function with a full Variational Stochastic World Model (VSWM) inspired by STORM. The entire system remains end-to-end differentiable.\\n\\n1.  **Learnable Submodules (with VSWM Integration):**\\n    *   **Encoder Module (`q_ϕ(z_t|s_t)`):** An inference network that encodes an actual state `s_t` into a posterior distribution over latent states `Z_t`. We use categorical distributions as in STORM.\\n    *   **Transformer-based Dynamics Predictor (`p_ϕ(z_{t+1}|...)`):** The transition prior. This is a GPT-like Transformer (as in STORM) that takes a history of latent states and actions and predicts a prior distribution over the next latent state, `Z_hat_{t+1}`.\\n    *   **Decoder Module (`p_ϕ(s_t|z_t)`):** Reconstructs the state `s_t` from a latent sample `z_t`, used for the VAE objective.\\n    *   **Reward Module (`R_θ(h_t, a_t)`):** Predicts the reward `r_t`.\\n    *   **Value Module (`V_θ(h_t)`):** Approximates the state value.\\n\\n2.  **Online Search in Latent Space (with Stochastic Expansion & Backup):**\\n    *   **Expansion Phase:** S-DTS follows DTS\\'s best-first search, using a learned policy `π_θ` to select a node `N*` for expansion. For an action `a`:\\n        *   The Dynamics Predictor computes the prior distribution `Z_hat_{child} = p_ϕ(z_{child}|h_{N*}, a)`.\\n        *   A next latent state `h_child` is *sampled* from this distribution. For discrete latents (as in STORM), the Gumbel-Softmax trick is used to allow gradient flow. For continuous latents, the reparameterization trick would be used.\\n        *   The new node `h_child` is added to the tree.\\n    *   **Backup Phase (Revised for Stochasticity):** To properly account for uncertainty, we use an **expected backup**. The value of a node is the maximum Q-value over actions. The Q-value is an expectation over the outcomes of the stochastic transition model.\\n        *   `Q(N, a) = E_{h_{child} ∼ p_ϕ}[R_θ(h_N, a) + γV(h_{child})]`\\n        *   In practice, this is approximated by sampling `K` next states `h_{child,k}` from the Dynamics Predictor for each action `a`, and averaging their values:\\n          `Q(N, a) ≈ R_θ(h_N, a) + (γ/K) * Σ_{k=1..K} V(h_{child,k})`\\n\\n3.  **Training and Loss Functions (Full VAE Objective):**\\n    The entire S-DTS network is trained end-to-end.\\n    *   **Primary RL Loss (`L_Q`):** MSE between the search output `Q_θ(s, a|τ)` and a target Q-value.\\n    *   **Conservative Q-Learning Loss (`L_D`):** When training offline, the CQL loss from the DTS paper is applied to the final search Q-values `Q_θ(s, a|τ)` to regularize the implicit policy and prevent divergence from the data distribution.\\n    *   **VSWM Losses (from STORM, Eq. 3):**\\n        *   **Reconstruction Loss (`L_rec`):** Encourages the decoder to reconstruct the original observation from the latent state.\\n        *   **Dynamics Loss (`L_dyn`):** A KL-divergence that trains the Dynamics Predictor to match the state distribution from the Encoder (`KL[sg(posterior) || prior]`).\\n        *   **Representation Loss (`L_rep`):** A KL-divergence that regularizes the Encoder (`KL[posterior || sg(prior)]`).\\n        *   **Reward/Continue Losses (`L_rew`, `L_con`):** Standard losses for predicting reward and termination.\\n    *   The overall loss is a weighted sum of these components. The tree expansion policy `π_θ` is optimized using REINFORCE with the telescoping sum trick from DTS.\\n\\n**Proposed Experiment Outline:**\\n\\n1.  **Environments:**\\n    *   **Stochastic Grid Worlds:** Custom 2D grid worlds with (a) configurable transition stochasticity (e.g., \"slippery ice\") and (b) a **rare, catastrophic event** (e.g., a 1% chance of a trap with a large negative reward) to test risk-aware planning.\\n    *   **Stochastic Procgen:** Use a subset of Procgen games (e.g., \\'climber\\', \\'jumper\\') and inject stochasticity (e.g., probabilistic enemy movement, random jump effectiveness).\\n    *   Data will be collected via expert trajectories for an offline setting, matching the DTS methodology.\\n\\n2.  **Models for Comparison:**\\n    *   **S-DTS (Proposed):** The full method described above.\\n    *   **DTS-Deterministic (Baseline 1):** The original DTS from paper 2.\\n    *   **DTS with Ensembles (Baseline 2):** Train an ensemble of M deterministic transition models. During search, randomly select one model per expansion. This tests a simpler uncertainty quantification method.\\n    *   **MBRL with Separately Trained VSWM (Baseline 3):** Train our VSWM standalone on the data. Use it with a non-differentiable planner like MCTS. This tests the benefit of joint optimization.\\n    *   **Model-Free Baseline (e.g., CQL):** A strong model-free method suitable for the offline setting.\\n\\n3.  **Metrics:**\\n    *   **Primary:** Average cumulative reward; Task success rate.\\n    *   **Secondary (Crucial for this idea):**\\n        *   **Risk-Adjusted Return:** Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) on the catastrophic grid world.\\n        *   **Uncertainty Calibration:** KL-divergence between the model\\'s predicted next-state distribution and the empirical distribution from a held-out test set.\\n        *   **Generalization:** Performance degradation curves when trained on one level of stochasticity (e.g., 20% slip) and tested on others (10%, 30%, 50%).\\n        *   **Computational Cost:** Wall-clock time for training and inference.\\n        *   **Gradient Variance:** Measure the variance of the REINFORCE gradient during training.\\n\\n4.  **Experimental Steps:**\\n    1.  **Phase 1: Feasibility Study.** Start with a \"Tiny-S-DTS\" on the grid world: small Transformer, few tree trials (`T=5`), few backup samples (`K=3`). Establish computational baseline and profile performance.\\n    2.  **Phase 2: Comparative Analysis.** Train all models on all environments.\\n    3.  **Phase 3: Ablation & Scaling Studies.**\\n        *   Perform a grid-search over `{tree trials T}` vs. `{Transformer depth}` and plot reward vs. wall-clock time to understand trade-offs.\\n        *   Ablate the number of backup samples `K`.\\n        *   Compare variance reduction techniques for the REINFORCE gradient (telescoping sum vs. value baselines).\\n\\n5.  **Success Criteria:**\\n    *   **Primary:** S-DTS significantly outperforms all baselines on cumulative reward and success rate, especially in highly stochastic environments.\\n    *   **Secondary:** S-DTS shows lower (better) CVaR, demonstrating risk-averse behavior. The uncertainty calibration metric improves during training. The ablation of joint training (Baseline 3) shows a clear performance drop.\\n\\n**Concrete Example:**\\nConsider a \"slippery ice\" grid world with a -100 reward trap. The agent needs to pass a narrow corridor next to the trap.\\n*   **Action:** `move_forward`.\\n*   **Environment Stochasticity:** 80% success, 10% slip left (into trap), 10% slip right.\\n*   **DTS-Deterministic:** Its model would likely learn the most frequent outcome (move forward). Its plan would hug the wall next to the trap, seeing it as the shortest path, oblivious to the 10% catastrophic risk. It would frequently fail.\\n*   **S-DTS (Proposed):**\\n    *   The `Dynamics Predictor` learns a categorical distribution over the three outcomes.\\n    *   The **expected backup** mechanism, by sampling `K` possibilities, would incorporate the high negative value of the trap into the Q-value for actions taken near it. A single sampled path might miss the trap, but the expectation over `K` samples will capture the risk.\\n    *   **Behavioral Difference:** The search would find that actions near the trap have a low expected value. S-DTS would learn to choose a slightly longer but safer path, avoiding the corridor entirely, resulting in higher average returns and a much better CVaR.\\n\\n**Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations**\\n*   **Risk 1 – Gradient Variance Explosion:** The dual stochasticity from REINFORCE (`π_θ`) and the world model sampling (`p_ϕ`) is the top risk.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** Start with DTS\\'s telescoping sum. Add a state-value baseline to the REINFORCE rewards. Implement entropy regularization on `π_θ` to prevent policy collapse. Use the Gumbel-Softmax trick for discrete latents to provide low-variance gradient paths.\\n*   **Risk 2 – Computational Overhead:** The transformer and `K`-sample backups add significant compute per search step.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** Start with the \"Tiny-S-DTS\" feasibility study. Use efficient transformer architectures (e.g., linear attention). Systematically analyze the trade-off a between planning budget (`T`, `K`) and performance to find a practical sweet spot.\\n*   **Risk 3 – Co-optimization Challenges:** The multiple, complex loss terms (`L_Q`, VAE losses) might compete and lead to unstable training.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** Use careful hyperparameter tuning for loss weights, possibly with a curriculum where the world model is pre-trained for a few epochs on the VAE objective before enabling the `L_Q` loss. Use gradient clipping and adaptive optimizers.\\n*   **Risk 4 – Non-Parametric Stochasticity:** The model assumes the world\\'s stochasticity fits a chosen parametric distribution (e.g., Categorical).\\n    *   **Mitigation:** This is a known limitation. We will start with environments where this assumption holds. For future work, exploring more flexible output distributions (e.g., mixture models) would be a natural extension.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': '**Defining the Revisions**\\n\\nI\\'m breaking down the task into key components.

            "\n",
            "**Observed Phenomenon**\n",
            "Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) agents employing sophisticated planning, such as Differentiable Tree Search (DTS), achieve strong performance by jointly optimizing their world model and search procedure. However, these methods typically rely on *deterministic* world models. This makes them vulnerable in non-deterministic environments, as they fail to represent or reason about the full range of possible outcomes, leading to performance degradation when faced with true environmental stochasticity or rare, high-impact events.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Problem Statement:**\n",
            "State-of-the-art differentiable search methods in MBRL, such as DTS, are fundamentally limited by their assumption of deterministic environment dynamics. This assumption restricts their applicability and robustness in many real-world scenarios which are inherently stochastic. There is a critical need for a framework that can integrate a rich, stochastic world model directly within a differentiable search algorithm and optimize the entire system end-to-end.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Condition:** We lack a framework for the joint, end-to-end optimization of a variational, stochastic, sequence-based world model (like those in the VAE family) and a differentiable tree search algorithm for decision-making under uncertainty.\n",
            "*   **Consequence:** The significant advantages of differentiable search—namely, the co-adaptation of the model and planner for improved sample efficiency and generalization—are not realized in stochastic domains. This limits progress towards agents that can plan robustly and safely in unpredictable, high-stakes environments.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Motivation:**\n",
            "Existing approaches fall short in stochastic environments:\n",
            "1.  **Deterministic Models (e.g., original DTS):** By learning a single-point estimate of the future, these models \"average out\" stochasticity. They are blind to low-probability, catastrophic events, leading to brittle and overconfident plans.\n",
            "2.  **Separately Trained Stochastic Models:** Training a stochastic world model first and then handing it to a planner (like MCTS) breaks the end-to-end optimization loop. The model is not optimized to be *useful for the specific planner*, and any inaccuracies are compounded during rollouts without recourse.\n",
            "3.  **High-Stakes Domains:** The need is particularly acute in domains like robotic manipulation (e.g., grasping objects with variable friction) or autonomous driving (e.g., tire slip on wet roads). In these cases, planning based on the \"average\" outcome is insufficient; the agent must reason about the entire distribution of possibilities to ensure safety and success.\n",
            "\n",
            "The proposed **S-DTS** (Stochastic Differentiable Tree Search) is designed to overcome these limitations. By integrating a variational stochastic world model, inspired by **STORM**, into the **DTS** framework, we create a system where the world model explicitly represents a *distribution* over possible next states. Crucially, we retain DTS's core strength: the ability to backpropagate gradients from the planning objective through the sampled rollouts to jointly optimize both the search policy and the parameters of the stochastic world model. This allows the search to learn to account for model uncertainty, and the model to produce predictions that are maximally informative for the planner.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Hypothesis**\n",
            "By integrating a variational stochastic world model into the Differentiable Tree Search (DTS) framework and jointly optimizing all components end-to-end, the resulting S-DTS agent will achieve significantly superior performance, risk-aware decision-making, and generalization in complex, non-deterministic environments compared to: (a) the original DTS with a deterministic world model, (b) DTS using a simpler ensemble-based uncertainty model, and (c) methods that use a separately trained stochastic world model with a non-differentiable planner.\n",

But STORM is trained with a variational inference objective... Without inference guidance, the latent dynamics may be undertrained. You cannot compute a valid KL divergence loss without the inference model.\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The original proposal oversimplified the world model, treating it as a single stochastic transition function `T_θ_STORM`. This is incorrect. STORM uses a full Variational Autoencoder (VAE) structure with an encoder (inference model), a decoder, and a dynamics predictor (transition model), all optimized with a specific set of VAE-based losses. The proposed `L_T_θ_STORM` based on simple Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) is insufficient and technically wrong for this architecture.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it:** I will completely restructure the `Proposed Method` to replace the simplistic \"Stochastic Transition Module\" with a **Variational Stochastic World Model** that correctly mirrors the architecture from STORM (Paper 1). This includes:\\n    1.  **Architecture:** Explicitly define the Encoder `q_ϕ(z_t|o_t)`, the Decoder `p_ϕ(o_t|z_t)`, and the Dynamics Predictor `g_ϕ(z_{t+1}|h_t)` which acts as the core transformer-based transition model.\\n    2.  **Loss Functions:** Replace the incorrect NLL loss with the full set of self-supervised losses from STORM (Paper 1, Section 3.1, Eq. 3-5). This includes the reconstruction loss (`L_rec`), reward/continue losses (`L_rew`, `L_con`), and the crucial Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence losses for regularizing the latent space: the dynamics loss `L_dyn = KL(sg(q_ϕ) || g_ϕ)` and the representation loss `L_rep = KL(q_ϕ || sg(g_ϕ))`. This ensures the world model is trained correctly.\\n\\n*   **Feedback Quote (Evaluator 2):** \"In stochastic trees, value backups are not just max over children; you need to marginalize over sampled paths (like expected backups or softmax Bellman).\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The original proposal\\'s `Backup Phase` incorrectly used `V(N) = max_a Q(N,a)`, which is only valid for deterministic transitions. In a stochastic setting, the value of a node should be the maximum of the expected Q-values over the actions.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it:** I will revise the `Backup Phase` in the `Proposed Method` to use an **expected backup** rule. The Q-value calculation will be defined as an expectation over the distribution of next states predicted by the world model: `Q(N, a) = R_θ(h_N, a) + γ * E_{h_child ~ P(.|h_N, a)}[V(h_child)]`. I will specify that this expectation will be approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate by drawing `K` samples of the next state `h_child` for each action during the backup, making the process computationally tractable.\\n\\n### Section 2: Gradient Flow and Training Instability\\nThis feedback from all three evaluators focuses on the high technical risk of combining multiple stochastic components.\\n\\n*   **Feedback Quote (Evaluator 1 & 3):** \"Gradient variance explosion – two nested stochastic layers (transition sampling + REINFORCE) may drown the signal.\" and \"How exactly do gradients flow through the sampled transitions? The reparameterization trick works for continuous distributions, but what about discrete stochastic environments?\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The proposal needs to be much more explicit about how gradients are handled for both the search policy and the world model sampling, and how the resulting high variance will be controlled. It also missed addressing discrete stochasticity.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it:**\\n    1.  **Clarify Gradient Flow:** In the `Proposed Method`, I will add a dedicated subsection explaining the gradient flow.\\n        *   For **continuous** latent states (e.g., Gaussian), I will confirm the use of the **reparameterization trick** (`h_child = μ + σ * ε`) to allow gradients from the planning loss `L_Q` to flow directly back to the world model\\'s parameters.\\n        *   For **discrete** latent states (as in STORM\\'s categorical VAE), I will propose using the **Gumbel-Softmax trick**. This provides a differentiable approximation to sampling from a categorical distribution, enabling end-to-end training in discrete latent spaces.\\n    2.  **Tackle Variance:** In `Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations`, I will explicitly detail a multi-pronged strategy to combat variance from the two stochastic sources (search policy and world model):\\n        *   **Search Policy (REINFORCE):** Leverage the `telescoping sum with baseline` from DTS (Paper 2, Section 3.5).\\n        *   **World Model:** The reparameterization/Gumbel-Softmax tricks are inherently lower variance than REINFORCE-style estimators.\\n        *   **General Stability:** Add entropy regularization for both the search policy `π_θ` and the world model\\'s output distribution to encourage exploration and prevent premature collapse of probabilities.\\n    3.  **Experiment:** I will add a specific experiment proposed by Evaluator 1 to the `Proposed Experiment Outline` to \"Compare telescoping-sum alone vs. telescoping + per-node baselines vs. Gumbel-Softmax, recording gradient variance.\"\\n\\n### Section 3: Experimental Design, Rigor, and Feasibility\\nThis feedback from Evaluators 1 and 3 questions the practicality, baselines, and evaluation depth.\\n\\n*   **Feedback Quote (Evaluator 1 & 3):** \"Planner latency – even linear-attention Transformers... can be a wall-clock killer.\" and \"Start with Tiny-DTS... and show linear scaling charts.\" and \"Have you considered simpler baselines like DTS with ensemble models or uncertainty quantification?\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The experimental plan needs to be more practical, include a crucial baseline, and incorporate more rigorous metrics for a more convincing evaluation.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it:** I will completely revise the `Proposed Experiment Outline` to be more strategic and comprehensive.\\n    1.  **Phased Approach:** I will adopt the \"Tiny-DTS\" suggestion by structuring the experiments into two phases:\\n        *   **Phase 1: Feasibility & Scaling Analysis.** Use a lightweight \"Tiny S-DTS\" on a simple grid world to de-risk the project. The goal is to profile computational cost, validate variance reduction techniques, and generate scaling plots (reward vs. wall-clock time, reward vs. tree trials/model depth) as suggested by Evaluator 1.\\n        *   **Phase 2: Full-Scale Benchmark.** Use the best configuration from Phase 1 for a full comparison against all baselines on more complex domains like Stochastic Procgen.\\n    2.  **Stronger Baselines:** I will add **DTS with Ensembles** as a key baseline, as suggested by Evaluator 3. This method trains an ensemble of deterministic transition models and uses the variance in their predictions as a form of uncertainty. This directly tests whether our explicit stochastic modeling is superior to a simpler, powerful alternative.\\n    3.  **Richer Metrics:** I will add the advanced metrics suggested by Evaluator 1 to the evaluation criteria:\\n        *   **Uncertainty Calibration:** Track the KL divergence between the model\\'s predicted transition distribution and the empirical distribution of next states on a holdout set.\\n        *   **Risk-Sensitivity:** On a task with rare catastrophic events, measure performance using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR).\\n        *   **Generalization to Unseen Stochasticity:** Train on one level of stochasticity and test on others, plotting performance degradation curves.\\n\\n### Section 4: Motivation and Justification\\n\\n*   **Feedback Quote (Evaluator 3):** \"What is the theoretical justification for why joint optimization should outperform separately trained stochastic models with planning?\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The motivation for joint end-to-end optimization, the core benefit inherited from DTS, needs to be stronger and more intuitive.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it:** I will expand the `Motivation` section to provide a clearer qualitative argument. I will explain that a separately trained model optimizes for global one-step prediction accuracy (e.g., minimizing NLL across all data). In contrast, joint optimization allows the planning loss `L_Q` to provide a targeted gradient signal, teaching the world model to be more accurate *specifically in regions of the state space that are critical for making good decisions*. The world model learns to be *useful* for the planner, not just statistically accurate in a vacuum, which is the central hypothesis.\\n\\n<REVISED IDEA>\\n\\n## Generated Research Idea\\n\\n**Title:** S-DTS: Differentiable Tree Search with Variational Stochastic World Models\\n\\n**Observed Phenomenon**\\nModel-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) agents with sophisticated lookahead, like Differentiable Tree Search (DTS), achieve strong performance by jointly optimizing their world model and planner. However, their reliance on deterministic world models, as noted in the DTS paper (Mittal & Lee), makes them brittle in non-deterministic environments. They either learn an \"average\" transition that ignores crucial, low-probability events, or their performance degrades due to compounding model errors when faced with true environmental stochasticity.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nState-of-the-art differentiable planning methods in MBRL, such as DTS, are fundamentally limited by their assumption of environmental determinism. This restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios where stochasticity is the norm (e.g., robotics, game playing, finance). There is a critical need for a framework that can integrate an explicitly stochastic world model within a differentiable search algorithm and optimize the entire system end-to-end.\\n*   *Condition:* We do not have a method that enables the joint, end-to-end optimization of a deep generative world model (like a variational autoencoder with a transformer backbone) and a differentiable tree search algorithm for robust decision-making under uncertainty.\\n*   *Consequence:* The powerful benefits of co-adapting a planner and a world model are unrealized in stochastic domains. This forces a trade-off: either use a deterministic model that is mismatched with reality, or use a separately trained stochastic model that cannot adapt to the specific needs of the planner, leading to suboptimal and unsafe policies.\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\nExisting MBRL approaches fall short in stochastic environments:\\n1.  **Deterministic Models (e.g., original DTS):** Fail to capture the multi-modal nature of stochastic transitions, leading to poor risk assessment and planning.\\n2.  **Separately Trained Stochastic Models + Planner (e.g., MCTS):** This two-stage approach suffers from a disconnect. The world model is trained to minimize a global prediction error (like NLL), but this is not necessarily what the planner needs. A planner may only require high accuracy in specific, decision-critical regions of the state space.\\n3.  **Model-Free Methods:** While robust, they are often sample-inefficient as they must implicitly learn environmental stochasticity through a massive number of interactions.\\n\\nThe proposed **S-DTS** method is designed to overcome these limitations. The core motivation is that a planner will make superior decisions if its world model is not only aware of stochasticity but is also actively optimized to be *useful* for that specific planner. By integrating a variational stochastic world model inspired by STORM (Paper 1) into the DTS (Paper 2) framework, we hypothesize that:\\n\\nThe planning loss signal, backpropagated through the differentiable search and sampled transitions, will guide the world model to refine its predicted distributions in ways that directly improve decision-making. For instance, it might learn to be more precise about the probabilities of a catastrophic slip near a cliff, even at the cost of being less precise elsewhere, because the planning loss penalizes poor outcomes heavily. This targeted adaptation is impossible in a two-stage approach.\\n\\n**Hypothesis**\\nIntegrating a variational stochastic world model (inspired by STORM\\'s VAE architecture) into the Differentiable Tree Search (DTS) framework, and jointly optimizing all components end-to-end, will enable an agent to achieve significantly superior performance, risk-adjusted returns, and generalization in complex, non-deterministic environments compared to (a) the original DTS with a deterministic model, (b) DTS using an ensemble of deterministic models, and (c) methods using a separately trained stochastic world model with a non-differentiable planner.\\n\\n**Proposed Method:**\\nS-DTS extends the DTS architecture by replacing its deterministic world model with a fully-fledged variational stochastic world model and adapting the search algorithm accordingly.\\n\\n**1. Variational Stochastic World Model (Inspired by STORM, Paper 1):**\\nThis component replaces DTS\\'s simple submodules and models the world\\'s dynamics `p(s_{t+1}, r_t | s_t, a_t)` in a latent space.\\n*   **Encoder `q_ϕ(z_t | o_t)`:** A CNN that infers the posterior distribution of a latent state `z_t` from an observation `o_t`. This is the inference model.\\n*   **Decoder `p_ϕ(o_t | z_t)`:** A deconvolutional network that reconstructs the observation `o_t` from a latent state `z_t`, used for the reconstruction loss.\\n*   **Dynamics Predictor `g_ϕ(z_{t+1} | h_t)`:** A GPT-like Transformer (the sequence model) that takes a history of latent inputs and predicts the *prior* distribution over the next latent state, `P(z_{t+1}|h_t)`. This is our stochastic transition function.\\n*   **Reward/Continue Predictors:** MLPs that predict reward `r_t` and a continuation flag `c_t` from the sequence model\\'s hidden state `h_t`.\\n\\n**2. Online Search in Latent Space (Adapted from DTS, Paper 2):**\\nThe search proceeds as in DTS, but with two key modifications for handling stochasticity:\\n*   **Stochastic Expansion Phase:** When a node `N*` is selected for expansion with action `a`, the Dynamics Predictor is used to generate a distribution over the next latent state: `P(h_child | h_{N*}, a)`. A next latent state `h_child` is then **sampled** from this distribution. This sampling is made differentiable (see Gradient Flow below).\\n*   **Expected Backup Phase:** The Bellman backup is modified to handle stochastic outcomes. The Q-value is computed as an expectation over the model\\'s predicted next-state distribution:\\n    `Q(N, a) = R_θ(h_N, a) + γ * E_{h_child ~ P(h_child | h_N, a)}[V(h_child)]`\\n    This expectation is approximated tractably using a Monte Carlo estimate with `K` samples per action. The node value is `V(N) = max_a Q(N, a)`.\\n\\n**3. Differentiable Gradient Flow through Sampling:**\\nTo enable end-to-end optimization, we ensure gradients from the planning loss `L_Q` can flow back through the sampling step in the expansion phase.\\n*   **Continuous Latent States:** For Gaussian distributions, we use the **reparameterization trick** (`h_child = μ + σ * ε, where ε ~ N(0,I)`).\\n*   **Discrete Latent States:** For categorical distributions (as in STORM), we use the **Gumbel-Softmax trick** to obtain a continuous, differentiable approximation of the sampled latent state.\\n\\n**4. Training and Loss Functions:**\\nThe entire S-DTS network is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function.\\n*   **Primary RL Loss (`L_Q`):** The mean squared error between the search-derived Q-values `Q_θ(s, a|τ)` and a target, as in DTS.\\n*   **CQL Regularization (`L_D`):** When training offline, this loss from the DTS paper is applied to the final Q-values to prevent policy deviation from the expert data.\\n*   **World Model Self-Supervised Losses (from STORM, Paper 1, Eq. 3-5):** These are crucial for training a consistent and accurate world model. The total world model loss `L_WM` is a weighted sum of:\\n    *   Reconstruction Loss (`L_rec`): `||o_t_recon - o_t||^2`\\n    *   Reward/Continue Losses (`L_rew`, `L_con`)\\n    *   Dynamics Loss (`L_dyn`): `KL(sg(q_ϕ) || g_ϕ)` to train the predictor.\\n    *   Representation Loss (`L_rep`): `KL(q_ϕ || sg(g_ϕ))` to regularize the encoder.\\n*   **REINFORCE for Search Policy:** The stochastic tree expansion policy `π_θ` is optimized using the REINFORCE objective with the telescoping sum trick from DTS (Paper 2, Sec 3.5) to minimize the expected `L_Q`.\\n\\n**Proposed Experiment Outline:**\\nThe experiment is structured in two phases to manage technical risk and ensure rigor.\\n\\n**Phase 1: Feasibility and Scaling Analysis (on Stochastic Grid Worlds)**\\n*   **Goal:** De-risk the approach, test feasibility, and understand computational trade-offs.\\n*   **Environment:** A configurable \"slippery ice\" grid world with stochastic transitions and rare, catastrophic trap states.\\n*   **Model:** A \"Tiny S-DTS\" with a small Transformer (e.g., 2-4 layers, linear attention) and limited tree search trials.\\n*   **Experiments:**\\n    1.  **Computational Profiling:** Plot wall-clock time vs. {number of tree trials `T`, number of MC samples `K`, Transformer depth}.\\n    2.  **Variance Reduction Analysis:** Compare gradient variance for different strategies (telescoping sum, Gumbel-Softmax, entropy regularization) to validate our stability mitigations.\\n    3.  **Risk-Sensitivity Analysis:** On the trap-state environment, measure and compare the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of S-DTS and baselines.\\n\\n**Phase 2: Full-Scale Benchmark (on Stochastic Procgen)**\\n*   **Goal:** Demonstrate superior performance and generalization against strong baselines.\\n*   **Environments:** Subset of Procgen games (e.g., `climber`, `jumper`, `heist`) modified with explicit, non-deterministic mechanics like \"sticky actions\" (_p_ chance of not moving), \"enemy teleportation\" (enemy has _p_ chance to warp to a nearby location), and probabilistic rewards.\\n*   **Models for Comparison:**\\n    1.  **S-DTS (Proposed):** The full method using the best configuration from Phase 1.\\n    2.  **DTS-Deterministic (Baseline 1):** Original DTS from Paper 2.\\n    3.  **DTS with Ensembles (Baseline 2):** DTS using an ensemble of 5 deterministic transition models to represent uncertainty. A very strong baseline.\\n    4.  **MBRL with Separately Trained WM (Baseline 3):** A VAE/Transformer world model trained independently, then used with an MCTS planner.\\n    5.  **Model-Free RL (Baseline 4):** A strong offline RL baseline like CQL.\\n*   **Primary Success Criteria & Metrics:**\\n    *   **Performance:** Average cumulative reward and task success rate. S-DTS should significantly outperform all baselines.\\n    *   **Uncertainty Calibration:** Track KL-divergence between the model\\'s predicted and the empirical next-state distributions on a held-out dataset.\\n    *   **Generalization:** Train on one level of stochasticity (e.g., 20% slip) and test on unseen levels (10%, 40%), plotting performance degradation curves.\\n\\n**Concrete Example:**\\nConsider a `heist` game where a valuable gem has a 10% chance of being a booby trap that ends the level with a large negative reward.\\n*   **DTS-Deterministic:** Its model would likely learn the high-probability outcome (it\\'s a gem, positive reward) and always plan to grab it. It would be blind to the 10% risk and perform poorly on average.\\n*   **DTS with Ensembles:** Some models in the ensemble might learn the trap outcome if they see it in the data. The planner might see conflicting predictions and become more cautious, showing better performance.\\n*   **S-DTS (Proposed):** Its `T_θ_STORM` would explicitly model a bimodal distribution for the state after picking up the item: a high-probability state with high value, and a low-probability terminal state with very low value. The expected value backup would average over these outcomes. The planner, guided by these calibrated expectations, would learn to approach the gem only if the potential reward sufficiently outweighs the 10% risk of catastrophe, leading to the most robust policy.\\n\\n**Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations**\\n*   **Risk 1 – Training Instability:** The two nested stochastic components (REINFORCE for search policy, sampling from the world model) could cause high variance.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** We will use a multi-faceted approach: (1) The telescoping sum trick from DTS for the REINFORCE component. (2) Low-variance gradient estimators like reparameterization/Gumbel-Softmax for the world model sampling step. (3) Entropy regularization on both the search policy and the world model\\'s output distribution to prevent premature collapse and aid exploration.\\n*   **Risk 2 – Computational Overhead:** The Transformer-based world model and Monte Carlo backups will be slow inside the search loop.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** The Phase 1 feasibility study is our primary mitigation. We will use an efficient Transformer architecture (e.g., linear attention) as inspired by STORM\\'s focus on efficiency and carefully tune the trade-off between planning quality and speed by controlling the number of search trials `T` and MC samples `K`.\\n*   **Risk 3 – Inaccurate World Model:** The VAE might fail to learn accurate predictive distributions from limited offline data.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** The robust self-supervised losses from STORM (`L_rec`, `L_dyn`, `L_rep`) provide a strong training signal. We can adjust the weight on the world model loss `L_WM`. We will also investigate curriculum learning, starting with simpler stochastic dynamics.\\n*   **Risk 4 - Credit Assignment:** Mismatched learning scales between the fast-improving RL objective (`L_Q`) and the slower self-supervised `L_WM`.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** Careful tuning of learning rates for the world model vs. the actor-critic components. The use of direct gradient flow via reparameterization/Gumbel-Softmax ensures the planning loss directly influences the world model\\'s parameters in a targeted way.

However, their reliance on deterministic world models, as noted in the DTS paper (Mittal & Lee), makes them brittle in non-deterministic environments. They either learn an \"average\" transition that ignores crucial, low-probability events, or their performance degrades due to compounding model errors when faced with true environmental stochasticity.\n",

There is a critical need for a framework that can integrate an explicitly stochastic world model within a differentiable search algorithm and optimize the entire system end-to-end.\n",

A planner may only require high accuracy in specific, decision-critical regions of the state space.\n",

My goal is to address every critical point, fix the technical flaws, and incorporate the constructive suggestions to strengthen the proposal.\\n\\n### Section 1: World Model Integration (Major Technical Flaw)\\n\\n- **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    - **Evaluator 2:** \"The write up treats STORM’s world model as a drop-in replacement for DTS’s deterministic MLP. But STORM is trained with a variational inference objective on 1-step transitions... storm cannot be used directly as a plug and play module.\"\\n    - **Evaluator 2:** \"In storm, training relies on a learned inference network to approximate the posterior for variational learning. This is never mentioned in the writeup. Without inference guidance, the latent dynamics may be undertrained. You cannot compute a valid KL divergence loss without the inference model.\"\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The original proposal is technically incorrect. It oversimplifies the integration by treating STORM\\'s world model as a simple stochastic transition function. I must replace this with the full variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture from STORM, which includes an encoder (the inference network), a decoder, and a dynamics model (the prior). The loss function for the world model must also be corrected to include the reconstruction loss and the two KL-divergence losses (dynamics and representation loss) that are central to STORM\\'s training.\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will rename the \"Stochastic Transition Module\" to a more accurate \"Variational Stochastic World Model (VS-WM)\" to reflect its true nature.\\n    2.  In the `Proposed Method` section, I will explicitly define the components of the VS-WM, citing STORM (Section 3.1):\\n        - **Encoder `q_ϕ(z_t | o_t)`:** This is the missing inference network. It takes an observation `o_t` and outputs a posterior distribution over latent states.\\n        - **Decoder `p_ϕ(o_t | z_t)`:** Reconstructs the observation from a latent state.\\n        - **Dynamics Predictor `g_ϕ(ẑ_{t+1}|h_t)`:** This is the transformer-based model that predicts the *prior* distribution of the next latent state based on history, which is what the planner will use.\\n    3.  In the `Training and Loss Functions` subsection, I will replace the single, incorrect `L_T_θ_STORM` with the full set of VAE losses from STORM (Eq. 3, 4a, 5a, 5b):\\n        -   **Reconstruction Loss (`L_rec`):** Ensures the latent space captures meaningful visual information.\\n        -   **Dynamics Loss (`L_dyn`):** Trains the dynamics predictor to match the posterior from the encoder. `KL[sg(q_ϕ) || g_ϕ]`.\\n        -   **Representation Loss (`L_rep`):** Regularizes the encoder to not deviate too far from the dynamics model\\'s predictions. `KL[q_ϕ || sg(g_ϕ)]`.\\n        -   The total world model loss will be a weighted sum (`L_WM = L_rec + β1*L_dyn + β2*L_rep + ...`).\\n\\n### Section 2: Tree Backup Mechanism (Major Technical Flaw)\\n\\n- **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    - **Evaluator 2:** \"In stochastic trees, value backups are not just max over children; you need to marginalize over sampled paths (like expected backups or softmax Bellman).\"\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The `Backup Phase` description in the original idea is incorrect for a stochastic environment. It performs a Bellman update based on a single sampled child, which ignores the distributional nature of the transitions.\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will rewrite the `Backup Phase` in the `Proposed Method` section to use a proper **Expected Backup Rule**.\\n    2.  The Q-value update for a node `N` and action `a` will be defined as: `Q(N, a) = R_θ(h_N, a) + γ * E_{h_child ~ P(h_child | h_N, a)}[V(h_child)]`, where `P` is the distribution predicted by the VS-WM.\\n    3.  I will state that this expectation will be practically approximated using **Monte Carlo estimation**. Specifically, we will sample `K` next states `h_child_k` from the predicted distribution and average their values: `Q(N, a) ≈ R_θ(h_N, a) + γ * (1/K) * Σ_{k=1..K} V(h_child_k)`.\\n    4.  The value of a node `N` will then be correctly calculated as `V(N) = max_a Q(N, a)`.\\n\\n### Section 3: Gradient Flow and Variance (High Risk)\\n\\n- **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    - **Evaluator 1:** \"Gradient variance explosion – two nested stochastic layers (transition sampling + REINFORCE) may drown the signal.\"\\n    - **Evaluator 3:** \"How exactly do gradients flow through the sampled transitions during tree expansion? The reparameterization trick works for continuous distributions, but what about discrete stochastic environments?\"\\n    - **Evaluator 1:** \"Variance-reduction effectiveness Experiment: Compare telescoping-sum alone vs. telescoping + per-node baselines vs. Gumbel-Softmax, recording gradient variance.\"\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The proposal needs to be more explicit about how gradients are handled for both the search policy and the stochastic world model, and it needs a stronger plan to mitigate the high variance.\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will add a new subsection in `Proposed Method` titled **\"Gradient Flow and Variance Reduction\"**.\\n    2.  This section will detail the two main gradient pathways:\\n        -   **Gradient through the World Model:** For continuous latent states, I will specify using the **reparameterization trick** (`h_child = μ + σ * ε`) to allow gradients from the planning loss `L_Q` to flow back into the world model `W_ϕ`. For discrete latent spaces (as used in STORM), I will specify using the **Gumbel-Softmax trick**.\\n        -   **Gradient for the Search Policy:** I will reiterate the use of REINFORCE with the **telescoping sum trick** from DTS (Section 3.5) as the primary variance reduction method.\\n    3.  I will add an explicit experiment to the `Proposed Experiment Outline`, as suggested by Evaluator 1, to empirically measure and compare the effectiveness of different variance reduction techniques on gradient stability during training.\\n\\n### Section 4: Computational Cost and Feasibility\\n\\n- **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    - **Evaluator 1:** \"Planner latency – even linear-attention Transformers inside hundreds of tree expansions can be a wall-clock killer.\"\\n    - **Evaluator 1/3:** \"Start with Tiny-DTS: 4-layer Performer, max tree depth 3, and show linear scaling charts.\"\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The experimental plan is too ambitious and doesn\\'t address the critical risk of computational infeasibility.\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will restructure the `Proposed Experiment Outline` into a **two-phase approach**:\\n        -   **Phase 1: Feasibility & Scaling Analysis.** This phase will use a \"Tiny S-DTS\" on the simpler stochastic grid worlds. Its goal is to benchmark performance and computational cost. I will explicitly state that we will plot wall-clock time against key parameters like {number of tree trials `T`, number of MC samples `K` for backups, Transformer depth}. This directly implements the reviewer\\'s suggestion.\\n        -   **Phase 2: Full Benchmark Evaluation.** Once feasibility is confirmed and parameters are tuned, this phase will scale up the model to run on stochastic Procgen and perform the full comparison against all baselines.\\n    2.  In `Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations`, I will update the mitigation for \"Computational Overhead\" to reflect this phased experimental plan, which is our primary risk-reduction strategy.\\n\\n### Section 5: Experimental Design, Baselines, and Metrics\\n\\n- **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    - **Evaluator 3:** \"Have you considered simpler baselines like DTS with ensemble models or uncertainty quantification...?\"\\n    - **Evaluator 1:** \"Failure modes under rare but catastrophic outcomes Experiment: ...measure risk-adjusted returns (CVaR).\"\\n    - **Evaluator 1:** \"Generalisation to unseen stochasticity levels. Experiment: Train with slip = 20 %; test at 10 %, 30 %, 50 %. Observe degradation curves.\"\\n    - **Evaluator 1:** \"Does joint training really calibrate uncertainty? Experiment: Track KL-divergence between predicted transition distribution and empirical next-state histogram...\"\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The experimental design can be made more rigorous with better baselines and more insightful metrics.\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  **Add Baselines:** In the `Models for Comparison` subsection, I will add **\"DTS with Ensembles\"** as a crucial baseline. This method trains an ensemble of deterministic transition models and uses them within DTS, providing a strong alternative for handling uncertainty.\\n    2.  **Add Desrisking Experiments:** I will add the specific, targeted experiments suggested by Evaluator 1 into the experimental plan:\\n        -   An experiment in grid-world with a rare, catastrophic event, using **CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk)** as a metric.\\n        -   A generalization experiment to test on **unseen levels of stochasticity**.\\n        -   A world model analysis experiment to track **uncertainty calibration** (e.g., predicted vs. empirical KL-divergence).\\n    3.  **Clarify CQL:** I will clarify in the `Training and Loss Functions` section that the CQL loss (`L_D`) is applied to the final Q-values `Q_θ(s, a|τ)` returned by the search to regularize the agent\\'s effective policy in the offline setting, as done in the original DTS paper.\\n\\n### Pertinence of other feedback\\n- **Feedback not to address**: The suggestions to explore \"diffusion over graphs\" or deploy on a \"bimanual robot\" (from Evaluator 1\\'s \\'more_novel\\'/\\'more_audacious\\' sections) are excellent future work but are beyond the scope of making this initial idea feasible. My focus will be on the \"more_feasible\" feedback to ensure the core concept is sound and demonstrable first. I will acknowledge these as future directions in the conclusion.\\n\\nBy systematically applying these changes, I will transform the original idea from a technically flawed concept into a robust, feasible, and compelling research proposal that directly incorporates and addresses the expert feedback.\\n\\n<REVISED IDEA>\\n\\n## Generated Research Idea\\n\\n**Title:** Variational Differentiable Tree Search: End-to-End Planning in Latent Space for Stochastic Environments\\n\\n**Observed Phenomenon**\\nModel-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) methods that use online planning, such as Differentiable Tree Search (DTS), achieve strong performance by jointly optimizing a world model and a search algorithm. However, DTS and similar methods are designed for deterministic worlds. When deployed in non-deterministic environments, their deterministic world models fail to capture environmental stochasticity, leading them to learn an \"average\" world dynamic. This can result in sub-optimal or unsafe policies, as the planner is blind to low-probability, high-impact events.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nState-of-the-art differentiable search methods in MBRL are constrained by their reliance on deterministic world models, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that are inherently stochastic. While methods exist for learning stochastic world models (e.g., STORM), they are typically trained separately from the planner, which prevents the planner and model from co-adapting. This separation means the world model is not optimized for the specific states and transitions that are most critical for the planner\\'s decision-making process.\\n\\n*   *Condition:* We lack a framework that can jointly optimize a powerful, *stochastic* world model (capable of representing a distribution over next states) with a *differentiable tree search* algorithm in an end-to-end fashion.\\n*   *Consequence:* The benefits of differentiable planning—learning a world model that is specifically useful for the planner—are lost in stochastic environments. Agents cannot reason effectively about uncertainty during planning, leading to poor sample efficiency and brittle policies that fail to generalize to novel situations or handle risk appropriately.\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\nOur proposed method, Variational Differentiable Tree Search (S-DTS), aims to bridge this gap.\\n1.  **Limitation of DTS:** The original DTS (Paper 2) learns a deterministic transition function, which is fundamentally mismatched with stochastic environments. It cannot represent or plan for multiple possible outcomes of an action.\\n2.  **Limitation of Separate Training:** Simply plugging a pre-trained stochastic world model (like STORM from Paper 1) into a planner misses the key insight of DTS. The world model would be trained to minimize global prediction error, which is different from being accurate in the specific, task-relevant regions of the state space that the planner explores.\\n3.  **The S-DTS Advantage:** S-DTS integrates a **Variational Stochastic World Model (VS-WM)**, inspired by STORM\\'s architecture, directly into the DTS framework. The core motivation is that **joint optimization provides a powerful, targeted learning signal**. The overall planning loss, `L_Q`, backpropagates through the entire differentiable search process, including the sampled transitions from the VS-WM. This teaches the VS-WM not just to be a good general predictor, but to be an accurate predictor *specifically for the transitions that matter most for making good decisions*. The planner, in turn, learns to account for the specific uncertainties expressed by its co-adapted world model. This synergy is expected to yield more robust and efficient learning.\\n\\n**Hypothesis**\\nBy integrating a variational stochastic world model (VS-WM) into the Differentiable Tree Search (DTS) framework and jointly optimizing all components end-to-end—including the world model parameters, the value function, and the search policy—the resulting agent will achieve significantly superior performance, risk-adjusted returns, and generalization in non-deterministic environments compared to (a) the original DTS with a deterministic model, (b) DTS with an ensemble of deterministic models, and (c) methods using a separately trained stochastic world model with MCTS.\\n\\n**Proposed Method:**\\nS-DTS extends the DTS architecture by replacing its deterministic transition function with a full Variational Stochastic World Model (VS-WM) and adapting the search and backup mechanisms accordingly.\\n\\n**1. Variational Stochastic World Model (VS-WM)**\\nInspired by STORM (Paper 1, Section 3.1), the VS-WM consists of three jointly optimized components:\\n*   **Encoder `q_ϕ(z_t | o_t)`:** A CNN that acts as an inference network, mapping a real observation `o_t` to the parameters of a posterior distribution over latent states `z_t`. We use categorical distributions as in STORM.\\n*   **Decoder `p_ϕ(ô_t | z_t)`:** A deconvolutional network that reconstructs the observation `ô_t` from a latent state `z_t`.\\n*   **Dynamics Predictor `g_ϕ(P(ẑ_{t+1}) | h_t)`:** A GPT-like Transformer that takes a sequence of latent-action embeddings and outputs the parameters of the *prior* distribution `P(ẑ_{t+1})` over the next latent state. This is the predictive model used by the planner.\\n\\n**2. Online Search in Latent Space**\\nThe search process follows DTS but is adapted for the VS-WM.\\n*   **Expansion Phase:** The best-first search, guided by the stochastic tree expansion policy `π_θ`, selects a node `N*` to expand. For each action `a`:\\n    1.  The dynamics predictor `g_ϕ` is used to get the prior distribution over the next latent state: `P(ẑ_{child} | h_{N*}, a)`.\\n    2.  A next latent state `ẑ_child` is **sampled** from this distribution. To enable gradient flow, this sampling is made differentiable using the **Gumbel-Softmax trick** for the categorical latent variables.\\n    3.  The new node is added to the tree.\\n*   **Backup Phase (Expected Backups):** Value backups must account for transition stochasticity. The Q-value for a node `N` and action `a` is the expected value over possible next states:\\n    `Q(N, a) = R_θ(h_N, a) + γ * E_{ẑ_child ~ P(ẑ_child | h_N, a)}[V(ẑ_child)]`\\n    This expectation is approximated using **Monte Carlo estimation** by drawing `K` samples from the dynamics predictor and averaging their values:\\n    `Q(N, a) ≈ R_θ(h_N, a) + γ * (1/K) * Σ_{k=1 to K} V(ẑ_{child,k})`\\n    The node\\'s value is then `V(N) = max_a Q(N, a)`.\\n\\n**3. Gradient Flow and Variance Reduction**\\nWe have two sources of stochasticity, each requiring careful gradient management:\\n*   **Gradient through World Model:** The Gumbel-Softmax trick allows the end-to-end planning loss `L_Q` to flow back through the sampling step in the expansion phase, providing a direct optimization signal to the Dynamics Predictor `g_ϕ`.\\n*   **Gradient for Search Policy:** The search policy `π_θ` is trained via REINFORCE. To combat high variance, we use the **telescoping sum trick** from DTS (Paper 2, Section 3.5) and add a learned value function as a baseline.\\n\\n**4. Training and Loss Functions**\\nThe entire S-DTS model is trained end-to-end on a composite loss:\\n`L_total = λ_Q * L_Q + λ_D * L_D + L_WM`\\n*   `L_Q`: The primary RL loss (e.g., MSE between search output `Q_θ(s,a|τ)` and target Q-values).\\n*   `L_D`: The Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) loss from DTS (Paper 2, Eq. 10), applied to the final `Q_θ(s,a|τ)` values to regularize the policy in offline settings.\\n*   `L_WM`: The world model loss, adapted from STORM (Paper 1, Eq. 3), ensures the learned latent space is well-structured:\\n    `L_WM = L_rec + β1*L_dyn + β2*L_rep`\\n    *   `L_rec`: Reconstruction loss (`||o - ô||²`) from the decoder.\\n    *   `L_dyn`: Dynamics loss `KL[sg(q_ϕ) || g_ϕ]` to train the predictor.\\n    *   `L_rep`: Representation loss `KL[q_ϕ || sg(g_ϕ)]` to regularize the encoder.\\n\\n**Proposed Experiment Outline:**\\nThe experimental plan is structured in two phases to manage technical risk.\\n\\n**Phase 1: Feasibility & Scaling Analysis**\\n*   **Environment:** Custom stochastic grid worlds (e.g., \"slippery ice\") where stochasticity can be precisely controlled.\\n*   **Model:** A \"Tiny S-DTS\" with a small (e.g., 2-layer, as in STORM) Transformer and limited tree trials.\\n*   **Goal:**\\n    1.  Verify the stability of the end-to-end training pipeline.\\n    2.  Benchmark computational cost. **Primary Metric:** Plot wall-clock time vs. {number of tree trials `T`, MC samples `K`, Transformer depth}.\\n    3.  Compare variance reduction techniques (telescoping sum vs. baselines).\\n\\n**Phase 2: Full Benchmark Evaluation**\\n*   **Environments:**\\n    1.  Stochastic Grid World with rare catastrophic events.\\n    2.  Stochastic Procgen: Introduce probabilistic elements (e.g., enemy movement, action outcomes) to a subset of Procgen games (\\'climber\\', \\'ninja\\').\\n*   **Models for Comparison:**\\n    1.  **S-DTS (Proposed)**\\n    2.  **DTS with Ensembles (Baseline 1):** The original DTS using an ensemble of 5 deterministic transition models to capture uncertainty.\\n    3.  **DTS-Deterministic (Baseline 2):** The original DTS from Paper 2.\\n    4.  **MCTS + Separately Trained VS-WM (Baseline 3):** Train our VS-WM using only `L_WM`, then use it with a standard MCTS planner.\\n    5.  **Model-Free Baseline (e.g., CQL):** A strong model-free baseline.\\n*   **Primary & Secondary Success Criteria and Metrics:**\\n    *   **Performance:** Average cumulative reward.\\n    *   **Risk-Sensitivity:** **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)** on the catastrophic grid world to measure performance in the worst-case outcomes.\\n    *   **Generalization:** Train on one level of stochasticity (e.g., 20% slip) and test on unseen levels (10%, 40%) to plot **degradation curves**.\\n    *   **Uncertainty Calibration:** Track the **KL-divergence** between the VS-WM\\'s predicted transition distribution and the empirical distribution of next states on a held-out dataset.\\n    *   **Sample Efficiency:** Performance as a function of training steps/data.\\n\\n**Concrete Example:**\\nConsider the \"slippery ice\" grid world from the original idea, where `move_north` can result in slipping left or right. A pit with a large negative reward is nearby.\\n*   **DTS with Ensembles (Baseline):** An ensemble of deterministic models might each predict a different, but fixed, outcome. The planner might average these paths or see variance in predictions, but it doesn\\'t reason about the *probability* of each outcome. It might still choose a path close to the pit if the average path seems safe.\\n*   **S-DTS (Proposed):** The VS-WM predicts a *single distribution* over next states, `P(z\\') = {0.7: north, 0.15: slip-left, 0.15: slip-right}`. The expected backup rule `E[V(z\\')]` explicitly incorporates the low-probability, high-cost outcome of slipping into the pit. The `Q(N, move_north)` value will be lower if the slip outcomes lead to the pit. Consequently, the S-DTS planner will learn to select a safer path that is further from the pit, even if it is slightly longer, demonstrating superior risk-awareness.\\n\\n**Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations**\\n*   **Risk 1 – Training Instability:** The interaction of REINFORCE, Gumbel-Softmax sampling, and VAE losses can be highly volatile.\\n    *   **Fallback:** Our phased approach allows us to debug this on simpler environments first. We will use robust variance reduction (telescoping sum + baseline), gradient clipping, and entropy regularization for both the search policy and the world model\\'s output distribution to prevent premature collapse.\\n*   **Risk 2 – Computational Overhead:** The triple loop of training steps, search trials, and MC samples for backups with a Transformer model is very expensive.\\n    *   **Fallback:** Our feasibility analysis (Phase 1) is designed to find a workable trade-off. We will start with an efficient Transformer (as in STORM) and small `T` and `K` values, scaling up only as the budget allows.\\n*   **Risk 3 – Inaccurate World Model:** The VS-WM might fail to learn the true stochastic dynamics, especially rare events.\\n    *   **Fallback:** We can adjust the weights of the loss terms (e.g., increase `β1` on `L_dyn` or the weight of `L_Q`). Curriculum learning, starting with deterministic and gradually increasing stochasticity, can guide the model. The joint optimization with the `L_Q` signal is our main tool to force the model to be accurate where it matters.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': \"**Defining the Objective**\\n\\nI've started by dissecting the core requirement: to refine a research idea. My focus is split into two key deliverables, as I understand it, the Thinking Pad and the revised idea itself, based on the expert feedback. That's the first piece of the puzzle!\\n\\n\\n**Planning the Execution**\\n\\nI've identified the key components: the initial research idea and the expert feedback from three reviewers, alongside two essential reference papers. The first step is clear: to structure my response into the Thinking Pad and the Revised Idea, addressing the core challenge of integrating stochastic world models with differentiable planning. Understanding the characteristics of the two reference papers is key.\\n\\n\\n**Evaluating the Challenges**\\n\\nI'm now focused on the core issue: the high gradient variance inherent in integrating STORM and DTS. The existing plan necessitates both REINFORCE for the search policy (DTS) and sampling from the stochastic transition model (STORM). This double-dose of randomness is concerning. I'm considering variance reduction techniques; perhaps a control variate or a modified REINFORCE objective could help, though implementation details are still hazy. It's worth exploring how DTS handles rewards, and how to propagate these rewards through the tree during the *expected* backup step.\\n\\n\\n**Structuring the Response**\\n\\nI'm focusing on structuring the response now. The `<THINKING PAD>` will be a structured analysis of each reviewer's comments, grouping similar concerns for a cohesive discussion. I'm also considering how to best address the critical flaws identified in previous reflections. It looks like I'll be prioritizing a discussion on the VAE architecture for the STORM transition model, as the reviewers all emphasized it.\\n\\n\\n**Formulating a Solution**\\n\\nI'm refining my approach to address the evaluators' concerns. A core focus is the correct integration of STORM's VAE structure, which I plan to detail in the 'Proposed Method' using the encoder, decoder, and loss functions. Another challenge lies in correctly handling the tree backup in a stochastic tree. I'll be using an expected value, marginalizing the child node states and implementing the necessary changes. The overall aim is to correct my previous mistakes as suggested by the feedback.\\n\\n\\n**Refining the Implementation**\\n\\nI'm now focused on the technical execution, specifically addressing the high gradient variance. I plan to incorporate the reparameterization trick and Gumbel-Softmax to help gradients flow effectively. Additionally, I'll highlight the expected value backup as critical for a stochastic tree and emphasize the overall feasibility of this integration, based on reviewer feedback.\\n\\n\\n**Revisiting the Approach**\\n\\nI'm now carefully reviewing the provided feedback, to plan the revision process. I'm focusing on three major areas: integrating the STORM world model correctly with its VAE structure, addressing the backup mechanism in the stochastic tree, and mitigating the high gradient variance issue. My primary action will be to structure my work, which is the key to success!\\n\\n\\n**Addressing Feedback and Refinement**\\n\\nI'm now working on a complete reconstruction of my initial idea. This includes a detailed description of the STORM-VAE integration and the expected tree backup. Crucially, I'm developing a strategy for variance reduction and computational feasibility. The aim is to directly confront the evaluators' concerns, thus strengthening my research proposal.\\n\\n\\n**Clarifying the Plan**\\n\\nI'm now delving into the specific changes for the `<THINKING PAD>`. I'm grouping feedback and planning the revision. It will focus on addressing the core technical integration, tree backup mechanisms, and variance reduction, as well as providing experimental plans for evaluation and feasibility. Also, I'll be focusing on the evaluators' concerns.\\n\\n\\n**Synthesizing the Feedback**\\n\\nI'm now delving into the core of the task: synthesizing the evaluators' feedback, which falls into categories like world model integration, gradient variance, and computational cost. My plan involves grouping related concerns and outlining the specific changes needed in the  `<THINKING PAD>` and the  `<REVISED IDEA>` sections to address the reviewers' critiques. This involves restructuring the core components to achieve the requested outcome.\\n\\n\\n**Integrating Feedback and Planning**\\n\\nI'm now focusing on the specifics of the feedback, grouping concerns like VAE integration, stochastic tree backup, and gradient variance reduction. I'm developing an action plan, outlining changes for the  `<THINKING PAD>` and `<REVISED IDEA>` sections. I'm incorporating techniques to reduce variance, and the overall aim is to address reviewer criticisms and enhance my research proposal.\\n\\n\\n**Reviewing and Revising**\\n\\nI'm now integrating the expert feedback, focusing on core technical improvements like VAE integration, expected tree backups, and variance reduction. I will also group similar comments and plan their corresponding revisions within the `<THINKING PAD>` and `<REVISED IDEA>` sections, building a cohesive response.\\n\\n\\n\"}}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 53381, 'completion_tokens': 8339, 'total_tokens': 61720}}\n",

            "*   *Consequence:* The benefits of differentiable planning—learning a world model that is specifically useful for the planner—are lost in stochastic environments. Agents cannot reason effectively about uncertainty during planning, leading to poor sample efficiency and brittle policies that fail to generalize to novel situations or handle risk appropriately.\n",

            "Our proposed method, Variational Differentiable Tree Search (S-DTS), aims to bridge this gap.\n",
            "1.  **Limitation of DTS:** The original DTS (Paper 2) learns a deterministic transition function, which is fundamentally mismatched with stochastic environments. It cannot represent or plan for multiple possible outcomes of an action.\n",
            "2.  **Limitation of Separate Training:** Simply plugging a pre-trained stochastic world model (like STORM from Paper 1) into a planner misses the key insight of DTS. The world model would be trained to minimize global prediction error, which is different from being accurate in the specific, task-relevant regions of the state space that the planner explores.\n",
            "3.  **The S-DTS Advantage:** S-DTS integrates a **Variational Stochastic World Model (VS-WM)**, inspired by STORM's architecture, directly into the DTS framework. The core motivation is that **joint optimization provides a powerful, targeted learning signal**. The overall planning loss, `L_Q`, backpropagates through the entire differentiable search process, including the sampled transitions from the VS-WM. This teaches the VS-WM not just to be a good general predictor, but to be an accurate predictor *specifically for the transitions that matter most for making good decisions*. The planner, in turn, learns to account for the specific uncertainties expressed by its co-adapted world model. This synergy is expected to yield more robust and efficient learning.\n",

I will break down the process into analyzing the feedback and then performing the revision.\\n\\n### Part 1: Deconstructing the Feedback\\n\\nI\\'ll go through the feedback from each evaluator, identify the core criticisms, and plan the changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Analysis of Evaluator 1\\'s Feedback**\\n\\n*   **Overall:** Positive. The core idea of combining Conformal Prediction (CP) with γ-models is seen as elegant and sound. The strengths are good integration and actionable utility.\\n\\n*   **Weakness 1: Calibration Target Choice**\\n    *   **Quote:** \"you rely on γ-model self-rollouts to create “ground-truth” samples for CP. If the model is already mis-calibrated, the calibration set may inherit that bias.\"\\n    *   **What needs to change:** The method for generating the calibration set `D_cal` is flawed. It uses the model\\'s own (potentially biased) bootstrapped predictions to generate \"true\" future states (`s_e_i^{true}`). This is a major issue also highlighted by Evaluator 2.\\n    *   **How I\\'ll address it:** I will change the method for generating `s_e_i^{true}`. Instead of sampling from the target γ-model\\'s distribution, I will specify that `s_e_i^{true}` must be sampled from the *true discounted state occupancy distribution* by performing actual Monte Carlo rollouts in the environment. For a given `(s_t, a_t)`, we execute the policy `π` in the *real* environment, sample a future timestep `Δt` from a geometric distribution `Geom(1-γ)`, and take the resulting state `s_{t+Δt}` as `s_e_i^{true}`. This grounds the calibration in reality, making it an unbiased assessment of the model\\'s predictions against the true world dynamics. I will also add an experiment to ablate this choice, comparing calibration quality when `D_cal` is generated from real rollouts versus bootstrapped targets.\\n\\n*   **Weakness 2: High-Dimensional State Spaces**\\n    *   **Quote:** \"CP coverage sets on >64-dim latents can become near-empty or explode in radius, hurting practicality.\"\\n    *   **What needs to change:** The method as proposed does not have a clear strategy for scaling to high-dimensional state spaces like image latents.\\n    *   **How I\\'ll address it:** I will incorporate the evaluator\\'s excellent suggestion. For high-dimensional inputs (e.g., from a CNN encoder), I will add a step to the `Proposed Method` where we first learn a low-dimensional projector (`P: S -> R^d` where `d` is small, e.g., 8-16). The γ-model and the subsequent conformalization will operate on this low-dimensional summary. This explicitly addresses the curse of dimensionality for CP. I will mention that this projector could be a VAE bottleneck or trained with a contrastive loss like InfoNCE, as suggested.\\n\\n*   **Improvement Suggestion (Novelty): Conformalize Trajectories**\\n    *   **Quote:** \"treat state-action trajectories as sets and conformalize sequence likelihood instead of single-step s_e.

The new version will be more novel, robust, scalable, and the experimental plan will be more rigorous in testing the stated claims.\\n\\n<REVISED IDEA>\\n\\n## Generated Research Idea\\n\\n**Title:** Conformalized Trajectory-based γ-Models: Calibrated Uncertainty for Multi-Step Planning in World Models\\n\\n**Observed Phenomenon**\\nWorld models like the γ-model (Paper 1) can predict long-horizon distributions of future states, forming the basis for planning in model-based RL. However, they generate these predictions without an accompanying, reliable measure of their own confidence. This is especially problematic for multi-step rollouts, where small initial prediction errors can compound, leading the agent to trust entire imagined trajectories that are fundamentally flawed.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nModel-based RL agents often plan by performing multi-step rollouts in a learned world model. Current infinite-horizon models like γ-models lack a robust mechanism to quantify their *own epistemic uncertainty* over these entire imagined trajectories in a calibrated manner. This uncertainty is critical for distinguishing trustworthy plans from speculative hallucinations.\\n\\n*   **Condition:** We do not have a principled and computationally efficient method to produce calibrated uncertainty estimates for the *multi-step rollouts* (imagined trajectories) generated by infinite-horizon world models.\\n*   **Consequence:** Without trajectory-level uncertainty, an RL agent may over-trust its world model, especially in out-of-distribution states, under model misspecification, or in non-stationary environments. This leads to compounding prediction errors, sub-optimal and unsafe decisions, inefficient exploration, and learning instability.\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\nPaper 1’s γ-model provides an elegant framework for infinite-horizon prediction, enabling single-step sampling of the discounted future state occupancy. The γ-MVE algorithm extends this to `H`-step rollouts for value estimation. However, it treats all imagined steps as equally reliable. Inspired by Paper 2, which uses Conformal Prediction (CP) to provide calibrated uncertainty for robotic planning, we propose to conformalize the γ-model\\'s predictions.\\n\\nUnlike existing approaches, we move beyond single-step uncertainty. We introduce a method to quantify the uncertainty of an entire `H`-step trajectory imagined by the γ-model. This is crucial because planning relies on these sequences, and their validity is threatened by compounding errors. An agent that \"knows when its plan is built on shaky ground\" can dynamically alter its strategy.\\n\\nOur proposed non-Bayesian approach offers a computationally efficient alternative to expensive methods like deep ensembles or Bayesian Neural Networks for uncertainty quantification. By grounding calibration in real environment data, our method is designed to be robust to model bias and can provide a clear signal for both model misspecification (e.g., insufficient capacity) and environmental non-stationarity, prompting the agent to become more cautious and explore when its world model is no longer accurate.\\n\\n**Hypothesis**\\nIntegrating trajectory-level Conformal Prediction with γ-models to generate calibrated epistemic uncertainty scores for `H`-step model-based rollouts will enable RL agents to achieve superior sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and robustness to environmental shifts compared to agents using standard γ-models.\\n\\n**Proposed Method:**\\nThe core idea is to use Conformal Prediction to calibrate the γ-model\\'s ability to predict `H`-step future state trajectories. We focus on γ-models instantiated as conditional Normalizing Flows (from Paper 1, Alg. 2) due to their tractable density evaluation.\\n\\n1.  **Projector for High-Dimensional States (Optional):** For image-based environments, first train a projector `P: S -> R^d` (e.g., a VAE encoder) that maps high-dimensional states `s` to a low-dimensional latent space `z ∈ R^d`. The γ-model and CP will operate in this space.\\n\\n2.  **Train γ-Model (`µ_θ`):** Train a γ-model `µ_θ(z_e | z_t, a_t)` on the latent space `Z` as described in Paper 1 (Alg. 2), using transitions from a replay buffer.\\n\\n3.  **Collect Real-World Calibration Trajectories (`D_cal`):** Create a calibration dataset `D_cal = { ((z_t, a_t)_i, τ_i^{true}) }_{i=1}^{N_cal}`. This set must be distinct from the training data. For each entry:\\n    *   Sample a state-action pair `(s_t, a_t)` from experience. Obtain its latent representation `(z_t, a_t)`.\\n    *   From `s_t`, execute the current policy `π` for `H` steps in the **actual environment** to collect a true state sequence `{s_1^{true}, s_2^{true}, ..., s_H^{true}}`.\\n    *   Project this sequence into the latent space to get the true latent trajectory `τ_i^{true} = {z_1^{true}, ..., z_H^{true}}`.\\n\\n4.  **Calculate Trajectory Nonconformity Scores (`α_i`):** For each `((z_t, a_t)_i, τ_i^{true})` in `D_cal`:\\n    *   Generate a corresponding *imagined* trajectory `τ_i^{model} = {z_1\\', ..., z_H\\'}` by performing an `H`-step rollout of the γ-model `µ_θ`, starting from `z_t, a_t`.\\n    *   Define the nonconformity of the model\\'s prediction as the error between the true and imagined trajectories. A simple and effective score is the mean squared error in latent space: `α_i = (1/H) * Σ_{k=1 to H} ||z_k^{true} - z_k\\'||^2`. A high `α_i` means the model\\'s rollout was a poor match for reality.\\n\\n5.  **Determine Conformal Quantile (`q_val`):** Given a desired marginal miscoverage rate `ε_cal` (e.g., 0.1), `q_val` is the `ceil((N_cal+1)(1-ε_cal)) / N_cal` -th empirical quantile of the `α_i` scores. Any future imagined trajectory with an error greater than `q_val` will be considered \"uncertain\" or \"out-of-distribution\".\\n\\n6.  **Uncertainty-Aware Planning and Exploration:** At test time, for a new state-action pair `(z_t, a_t)`:\\n    *   **Uncertainty Score (`u_γ`):** To get a proactive uncertainty score, we measure the self-consistency of the model\\'s rollouts. Generate `K` imagined trajectories `τ^{(1)}, ..., τ^{(K)}` starting from `(z_t, a_t)`. The uncertainty score `u_γ(z_t, a_t)` is the variance across these rollouts: `u_γ = E_k[ (1/H) * Σ_{h=1 to H} ||z_h^{(k)} - z̄_h||^2 ]`, where `z̄_h` is the mean latent state at step `h` across the `K` rollouts. High variance implies the model is uncertain about the future.\\n    *   **Adaptive γ-MVE:** Modify the `γ-MVE` value estimator from Paper 1. The contribution of the model-based `H`-step rollout is re-weighted by its certainty. The value estimate can be a blend: `V(s_t) = (1 - u_γ) * V_{γ-MVE} + u_γ * V_{model-free}`. When uncertainty is high, the agent trusts its model-free value estimate more, preventing catastrophic planning based on faulty rollouts.\\n    *   **Uncertainty-Guided Exploration:** Use `u_γ` as an intrinsic reward bonus `r_bonus = β * u_γ(z_t, a_t)` to encourage the agent to collect data in regions where its world model is inconsistent and uncertain.\\n\\n**Proposed Experiment Outline:**\\n*   **Environments:**\\n    1.  Standard low-dim control: Pendulum, Acrobot (from Paper 1).\\n    2.  Non-stationary control: Pendulum with gravity that changes mid-training, to test robustness.\\n    3.  High-dim visual control: MiniGrid with pixel observations, to test the low-dimensional projector approach.\\n*   **Models and Baselines:**\\n    1.  **Model-Free SAC:** Standard Soft Actor-Critic.\\n    2.  **Standard γ-MVE SAC:** The primary baseline from Paper 1.\\n    3.  **Ensemble γ-MVE SAC:** A common uncertainty baseline using an ensemble of γ-models.\\n    4.  **Proposed System (Conf-γ-MVE SAC):** Our full method with adaptive γ-MVE and the exploration bonus.\\n*   **Experiment Steps & Primary Metrics:**\\n    1.  Implement and train all baselines and the proposed system.\\n    2.  **Primary Success Criteria:** Measure and compare sample efficiency (learning curves) and final asymptotic performance (average reward over last 10% of training) across all environments. We expect Conf-γ-MVE SAC to learn faster and/or achieve higher, more stable final rewards. In the non-stationary environment, we expect our method to recover much more effectively after the shift.\\n*   **Secondary Analysis and Ablation Studies:**\\n    1.  **Calibration Validity:** On a held-out test set, verify that the proportion of true trajectories `τ^{true}` with error `α > q_val` is approximately `ε_cal`.\\n    2.  **Ablation (Source of `D_cal`):** Compare the calibration quality (`q_val` stability and test coverage) when `D_cal` is generated from real environment rollouts vs. the γ-model\\'s bootstrapped targets (the flawed original idea).\\n    3.  **Ablation (Utility of Uncertainty):** Test the proposed system with: (a) only adaptive γ-MVE, (b) only exploration bonus, and (c) both.\\n    4.  **Model Misspecification Test:** Train a standard γ-model and our Conf-γ-model with an intentionally small network capacity. We hypothesize our method will produce high `u_γ` scores, correctly signaling the model\\'s inability to capture the dynamics.\\n    5.  **Visual Latent Analysis:** In MiniGrid, qualitatively analyze states with high `u_γ` to see if they correlate with visually ambiguous or complex scenes.\\n\\n**Concrete Example:**\\nConsider an agent in a MiniGrid environment approaching a closed door. It has never seen a door open before.\\n*   **Standard γ-MVE SAC:** The agent performs an `H`-step rollout. Its world model, having only seen closed doors, confidently predicts the door will remain closed in all future steps. It might wrongly conclude a room is inaccessible and pursue a much longer, sub-optimal path.\\n*   **Conf-γ-MVE SAC:** The agent performs `K` rollouts. Because the model has no experience with opening doors, the imagined trajectories might be noisy or inconsistent (e.g., flickering pixels around the door). This leads to a high variance and thus a high uncertainty score `u_γ`.\\n    *   **Adaptive γ-MVE:** The agent heavily down-weights its model-based plan and relies on a more conservative model-free value, preventing it from committing to the long detour.\\n    *   **Exploration:** The agent receives a large intrinsic reward for being at this uncertain state, motivating it to interact with the door (`try-open` action). This interaction provides crucial new data, allowing the world model to learn about opening doors, which will reduce uncertainty in the future.\\n\\n**Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations**\\n*   **Risk 1 – Computational Cost:** Generating `D_cal` from real rollouts and computing `u_γ` with `K` rollouts per step can be slow.\\n    *   **Fallback:** `D_cal` can be built offline or updated periodically, not every step. `K` for the `u_γ` calculation can be a small hyperparameter (e.g., 3-5). The main cost is RL training itself.\\n*   **Risk 2 – Trajectory Error Metric:** The choice of trajectory error metric (`α_i`) is a hyperparameter. `L2` distance might not be optimal for all latent spaces.\\n    *   **Fallback:** Start with `L2` as it is simple and robust. Alternatively, explore learned distance metrics or metrics based on the γ-model\\'s log-likelihood if rollouts are tractable.\\n*   **Risk 3 – Theoretical Guarantees for RL:** While CP provides a guarantee on prediction region coverage, how this translates to RL convergence guarantees is an open question.\\n    *   **Fallback:** This research focuses on the empirical demonstration of improved performance and robustness, which is a significant contribution. A full theoretical analysis of the learning dynamics is a valuable direction for future work.\\n*   **Risk 4 - Quality of Latent Projector:** A poor low-dimensional projection `P` could discard information essential for predicting dynamics.\\n    *   **Fallback:** The projector can be trained jointly with the world model to ensure it preserves dynamically relevant information, for example by including a reconstruction loss or a bisimulation metric in its objective.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': \"**Revising My Research**\\n\\nI've begun the process of meticulously analyzing the feedback.

For a given `(s_t, a_t)`, we execute the policy `π` in the *real* environment, sample a future timestep `Δt` from a geometric distribution `Geom(1-γ)`, and take the resulting state `s_{t+Δt}` as `s_e_i^{true}`.

            "**Observed Phenomenon**\n",
            "World models like the γ-model (Paper 1) can predict long-horizon distributions of future states, forming the basis for planning in model-based RL. However, they generate these predictions without an accompanying, reliable measure of their own confidence. This is especially problematic for multi-step rollouts, where small initial prediction errors can compound, leading the agent to trust entire imagined trajectories that are fundamentally flawed.\n",

            "Model-based RL agents often plan by performing multi-step rollouts in a learned world model. Current infinite-horizon models like γ-models lack a robust mechanism to quantify their *own epistemic uncertainty* over these entire imagined trajectories in a calibrated manner. This uncertainty is critical for distinguishing trustworthy plans from speculative hallucinations.\n",
            "\n",

            "*   **Consequence:** Without trajectory-level uncertainty, an RL agent may over-trust its world model, especially in out-of-distribution states, under model misspecification, or in non-stationary environments. This leads to compounding prediction errors, sub-optimal and unsafe decisions, inefficient exploration, and learning instability.\n",

            "Paper 1’s γ-model provides an elegant framework for infinite-horizon prediction, enabling single-step sampling of the discounted future state occupancy. The γ-MVE algorithm extends this to `H`-step rollouts for value estimation. However, it treats all imagined steps as equally reliable. Inspired by Paper 2, which uses Conformal Prediction (CP) to provide calibrated uncertainty for robotic planning, we propose to conformalize the γ-model's predictions.\n",

            "Unlike existing approaches, we move beyond single-step uncertainty. We introduce a method to quantify the uncertainty of an entire `H`-step trajectory imagined by the γ-model. This is crucial because planning relies on these sequences, and their validity is threatened by compounding errors. An agent that \"knows when its plan is built on shaky ground\" can dynamically alter its strategy.\n",

            "Our proposed non-Bayesian approach offers a computationally efficient alternative to expensive methods like deep ensembles or Bayesian Neural Networks for uncertainty quantification. By grounding calibration in real environment data, our method is designed to be robust to model bias and can provide a clear signal for both model misspecification (e.g., insufficient capacity) and environmental non-stationarity, prompting the agent to become more cautious and explore when its world model is no longer accurate.\n",

            "Integrating trajectory-level Conformal Prediction with γ-models to generate calibrated epistemic uncertainty scores for `H`-step model-based rollouts will enable RL agents to achieve superior sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and robustness to environmental shifts compared to agents using standard γ-models.\n",

The uncertainty score `u_γ(z_t, a_t)` is the variance across these rollouts: `u_γ = E_k[ (1/H) * Σ_{h=1 to H} ||z_h^{(k)} - z̄_h||^2 ]`, where `z̄_h` is the mean latent state at step `h` across the `K` rollouts.

If the model is already mis-calibrated, the calibration set may inherit that bias.\"\\n    *   Evaluator 2: \"Calibration procedure relies on sampling from target γ-model distributions, which may introduce bias if the target model is itself inaccurate.\"\\n    *   Evaluator 1 (desrisking): \"Does CP actually stay valid when γ-model targets are boot-strapped predictions? Ablate: build a small “sim-truth” dataset of real multistep rollouts...\"\\n\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:**\\n    The fundamental flaw is that the calibration process is circular. It uses the model\\'s own (potentially flawed) predictions (`µ_θ_s`) to generate the \"ground truth\" (`s_e_i^{true}`) for the calibration set `D_cal`. This violates the principle of calibrating against an objective truth and can lead to a model that is confidently wrong.\\n\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    I will completely overhaul the generation of the calibration dataset `D_cal`. Instead of sampling `s_e_i^{true}` from the target γ-model, I will generate true future states from **actual rollouts in the environment**.\\n    1.  The calibration data points `((s_t_i, a_t_i), s_e_i^{true})` will be generated by:\\n        a. Sampling `(s_t, a_t)` from a replay buffer.\\n        b. Executing `a_t` in the *real environment* to get `s_{t+1}`.\\n        c. Sampling `s_e_i^{true}` by applying the logic of the γ-model\\'s discounted horizon to the *real* trajectory. With probability `(1-γ)`, `s_e_i^{true} = s_{t+1}`. With probability `γ`, we continue the rollout in the environment for another step and repeat the process. This generates a true discounted future state sample without relying on the model\\'s potentially biased predictions.\\n    2.  This change will be reflected in the \"Proposed Method\" (Step 2: Collect Calibration Data) and the \"Proposed Experiment Outline\" will now include an experiment comparing calibration with real vs. model-generated data to explicitly validate this design choice.\\n\\n### Section 2: Novelty and Scope (Single-State vs. Trajectory)\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   Evaluator 1 (Novelty): \"treat state-action trajectories as sets and conformalize sequence likelihood instead of single-step s_e. Captures temporal compounding error, not just local mismatch.\"\\n    *   Evaluator 2 (Originality): \"Limited novelty - primarily a combination of existing techniques rather than fundamental algorithmic innovation\"\\n\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:**\\n    The original idea of applying CP to a single future state `s_e` is a straightforward combination of two methods and doesn\\'t tackle the more complex issue of compounding error over a trajectory. The novelty and significance can be substantially increased by shifting the focus from a single state to a sequence of states.\\n\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    I will pivot the entire proposal to be about **Trajectory-Level Conformal Prediction**.\\n    1.  **Title & Hypothesis:** The title will be changed to something like \"Conformalized Trajectory Models: Calibrated Uncertainty for Multi-Step Prediction in Model-Based RL\". The hypothesis will now focus on how trajectory-level uncertainty reduces compounding error.\\n    2.  **Method:**\\n        *   The world model will now be framed as predicting a trajectory of states `τ_pred = (s_1, ..., s_H)` given `(s_t, a_t, ..., a_{t+H-1})`.\\n        *   The nonconformity score `α` will be a *trajectory-level* metric, for example, the Mean Squared Error between the predicted latent trajectory and the true latent trajectory: `α_i = || z_{true_i}^{1:H} - z_{pred_i}^{1:H} ||^2`.\\n        *   The \"Concrete Example\" will be updated to show how a small error in an early state can compound, and how trajectory-level uncertainty would capture this, whereas single-step uncertainty might not.\\n\\n### Section 3: Scalability to High-Dimensional Spaces\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   Evaluator 1: \"High-dimensional state spaces: CP coverage sets on >64-dim latents can become near-empty or explode in radius, hurting practicality.\"\\n    *   Evaluator 1 (Feasibility): \"pre-compute low-rank latent summaries so CP runs on 8-D summaries, sidestepping curse-of-dimensionality.\"\\n    *   Evaluator 2 (Weakness): \"scalability to high-dimensional problems unclear\"\\n\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:**\\n    The method as proposed is not practical for image-based RL or other high-dimensional state spaces. A concrete mechanism for dimensionality reduction is needed.\\n\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    I will explicitly incorporate a dimensionality reduction step into the `Proposed Method` and `Experiment Outline`.\\n    1.  The method will state that for high-dimensional states (like images), a low-dimensional latent space `z` is first learned (e.g., using a VAE encoder or similar).\\n    2.  The γ-model (now a trajectory model) will operate entirely within this latent space `z`.\\n    3.  All Conformal Prediction calculations (nonconformity scores, quantiles) will be performed on the low-dimensional latent trajectories, `z^{1:H}`.\\n    4.  The experimental plan will include an image-based environment (e.g., MiniGrid or a simplified CARLA task) and an ablation study on the effect of the latent dimension size, as suggested by Evaluator 1.\\n\\n### Section 4: Definition of the Uncertainty Score\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   Evaluator 2: \"The uncertainty score definition (1 - p_inside) lacks theoretical justification - unclear why this specific formulation is optimal.\"\\n    *   Evaluator 2 (Question): \"What is the theoretical justification for using (1 - p_inside) as the uncertainty score? Have alternative formulations been considered?\"\\n\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:**\\n    The `u_γ = 1 - p_inside` metric is ad-hoc. A more principled score, directly linked to the conformal prediction framework, is needed.\\n\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    I will replace the old score with a new one based on the distribution of nonconformity scores for *hypothetical* model predictions.\\n    1.  At test time, for a given `(s_t, a_t)`, the model will generate `M` imagined future trajectories.\\n    2.  For each of these `M` imagined trajectories, we calculate its nonconformity score `α_j` *as if it were a calibration point*.\\n    3.  The uncertainty score `u_γ(s_t, a_t)` will be defined as the **expected nonconformity** of the model\\'s own predictions: `u_γ = (1/M) * Σ_{j=1 to M} α_j`.\\n    4.  Intuitively, if the model predicts trajectories that it considers to be highly non-conforming (i.e., they look unusual compared to the calibration data), it signals high uncertainty. This is a more direct and justifiable measure of the model\\'s self-assessed confidence.\\n\\n### Section 5: Experimental Rigor and Baselines\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   Evaluator 1: Suggested experiments on adaptive γ-MVE stability, exploration vs. value penalization, and scalability to images.\\n    *   Evaluator 2: Asked for comparison to \"ensemble-based or Bayesian approaches\" and performance on \"non-stationarity or distribution shift\".\\n\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:**\\n    The experimental plan needs to be more comprehensive to address these questions and strengthen the paper\\'s claims.\\n\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    I will significantly expand the `Proposed Experiment Outline`.\\n    1.  **New Baseline:** I will add a strong uncertainty-aware baseline: **Ensemble of γ-Models**. The uncertainty will be measured by the variance in predictions across the ensemble. This directly addresses the comparison to other popular uncertainty quantification methods. We will compare performance, calibration quality, and computational cost.\\n    2.  **New Experiment: Non-stationarity.** I will add an experiment where the environment dynamics are slightly changed *after* the model and calibration are finished (e.g., changing the mass of the pendulum). The hypothesis is that our method will show a sharp increase in uncertainty, allowing the agent to adapt more gracefully than the standard γ-model.\\n    3.  **Refined Ablations:** I will explicitly list the ablation and factorial studies suggested by Evaluator 1 (adaptive value expansion vs. exploration bonus; sensitivity to latent dimension).\\n\\n### Section 6: No Pertinent Feedback to Ignore\\n\\nAll feedback from both evaluators is highly relevant, constructive, and points to genuine weaknesses in the original idea. I will not be disregarding any of the core criticisms. The suggestions for a real-robot demo are excellent for \"audacity\" but can be framed as future work beyond the scope of this initial research project, which focuses on establishing the core algorithmic principles.\\n\\n<REVISED IDEA>\\n\\n## Generated Research Idea\\n\\n**Title:** Conformalized Trajectory Models: Calibrated Uncertainty for Compounding Error in Model-Based RL\\n\\n**Observed Phenomenon**\\nInfinite-horizon world models like γ-models (Paper 1) offer a sample-efficient way to learn long-term environment dynamics. However, they typically provide a single distributional prediction without a measure of confidence. When these models make multi-step predictions (rollouts), small initial prediction errors can compound over the horizon, leading to catastrophically wrong future-state predictions. Current methods lack a principled, computationally-efficient way to quantify the model\\'s uncertainty about an entire predicted *trajectory*, making it difficult for an RL agent to know when to distrust a long-term plan.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nModel-based RL agents that rely on multi-step rollouts are highly vulnerable to compounding prediction errors. Existing world models do not provide reliable, calibrated estimates of their own epistemic uncertainty over entire predicted trajectories. This prevents the agent from dynamically assessing the trustworthiness of its imagined plans.\\n\\n*   *Condition:* We lack a method to produce computationally-efficient, calibrated uncertainty scores that account for the compounding error over a multi-step prediction horizon in a world model.\\n*   *Consequence:* Agents may over-trust their world model\\'s long-term plans, especially in novel or poorly-learned regions of the state space. This leads to brittle policies, sub-optimal decision-making, and an inability to safely navigate environments where model inaccuracies can lead to failure.\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\nPaper 1 introduced γ-models, a powerful framework for infinite-horizon prediction. Its value-expansion method (γ-MVE) relies on model rollouts, which are susceptible to compounding error. Paper 2 demonstrates how Conformal Prediction (CP) can provide rigorous, calibrated uncertainty guarantees for complex models in robotics, particularly by disentangling different sources of uncertainty.\\n\\nThis research builds on these ideas by proposing a novel framework to **conformalize trajectory predictions** from a world model. Instead of applying CP to a single future state, we apply it to entire multi-step trajectories. This approach directly addresses the compounding error problem by measuring the model\\'s uncertainty over a whole sequence of states. A nonconformity score will measure the divergence between a predicted trajectory and a ground-truth trajectory, capturing how errors accumulate over time.\\n\\nBy providing the RL agent with a calibrated trajectory-level uncertainty score `u_τ`, it can:\\n1.  **Adaptively Trust Rollouts:** In the γ-MVE framework, the agent can shorten the model-based rollout horizon `H` or increase reliance on the model-free terminal value when `u_τ` is high, making its value estimates more robust.\\n2.  **Explore Safely and Efficiently:** Use `u_τ` as an intrinsic motivation signal to explore regions where the trajectory model is uncertain, efficiently reducing model error where it matters most.\\n\\nThis method is inspired by Paper 2\\'s use of CP for calibration but applies it to the dynamics problem of Paper 1. It offers a significant advantage over common baselines like deep ensembles, which are computationally expensive, by providing formal coverage guarantees with a single model.\\n\\n**Hypothesis**\\nIntegrating trajectory-level Conformal Prediction with a multi-step world model will produce calibrated epistemic uncertainty scores that reflect compounding error. An RL agent using these scores for adaptive planning (in γ-MVE) and uncertainty-guided exploration will demonstrate superior sample efficiency, robustness to non-stationarity, and higher asymptotic performance compared to agents using standard γ-models or ensemble-based uncertainty baselines.\\n\\n**Proposed Method:**\\nThe method involves training a latent trajectory model, then calibrating it using trajectory-level Conformal Prediction.\\n\\n1.  **Train Latent Trajectory Model:**\\n    *   For high-dimensional state spaces (e.g., images), first train a VAE-style model to learn an encoder `E: S -> Z` and decoder `D: Z -> S` mapping states `s` to a low-dimensional latent space `z`.\\n    *   Train a latent trajectory model `M_θ` that, given a latent state `z_t` and a sequence of actions `a_t, ..., a_{t+H-1}`, predicts a sequence of future latent states: `(z_t, a_t, ..., a_{t+H-1}) -> (ẑ_{t+1}, ..., ẑ_{t+H})`. This model can be an RNN or Transformer. The model is trained via supervised learning on real transitions from a replay buffer.\\n\\n2.  **Collect Real-World Calibration Trajectories (`D_cal`):**\\n    *   Create a calibration dataset `D_cal = { (z_{t_i}, a_{t_i:t_i+H-1}), z_{t_i+1:t_i+H}^{true} }_{i=1}^{N_cal}`. This set must be held-out from the model\\'s training data.\\n    *   For each entry: Sample a starting state `s_t` from experience. From `s_t`, execute the current policy `π` for `H` steps **in the actual environment** to collect a true state sequence `s_{t+1:t+H}^{true}` and action sequence `a_{t:t+H-1}`.\\n    *   Encode the true states to get the latent trajectory: `z_{t:t+H}^{true} = E(s_{t:t+H}^{true})`.\\n\\n3.  **Calculate Trajectory-Level Nonconformity Scores (`α_i`):**\\n    *   For each `i` in `D_cal`, use the trained model `M_θ` to predict the latent trajectory `ẑ_{t_i+1:t_i+H}` from the start state `z_{t_i}` and action sequence `a_{t_i:t_i+H-1}`.\\n    *   Compute the trajectory-level nonconformity score `α_i` as the Mean Squared Error between the predicted and true latent trajectories:\\n        `α_i = (1/H) * Σ_{k=1 to H} || z_{t_i+k}^{true} - ẑ_{t_i+k} ||^2`.\\n    *   A higher `α_i` means the model\\'s predicted trajectory was further from the real one, indicating higher non-conformance.\\n\\n4.  **Determine Conformal Quantile (`q_val`):**\\n    *   Given a desired marginal miscoverage rate `ε_cal` (e.g., 0.1), `q_val` is the `ceil((N_cal+1)(1-ε_cal)) / N_cal`-th empirical quantile of the sorted nonconformity scores `{α_i}`.\\n\\n5.  **Define and Compute Trajectory Uncertainty Score (`u_τ`):**\\n    *   At test time, for a query state `s_t`, the agent plans to execute an action sequence `a_{t:t+H-1}`.\\n    *   The model `M_θ` predicts the corresponding latent trajectory `ẑ_{t+1:t+H}`.\\n    *   The trajectory uncertainty score `u_τ` is simply the nonconformity score of this predicted trajectory:\\n        `u_τ(s_t, a_{t:t+H-1}) = (1/H) * Σ_{k=1 to H} || E(s_{t+k}) - ẑ_{t+k} ||^2`, where `s_{t+k}` are the states resulting from the planned actions in the model. A score `u_τ > q_val` indicates the planned trajectory is \"out-of-distribution\" with `1-ε_cal` confidence.\\n\\n6.  **Utilize Uncertainty (`u_τ`) in RL Agent:**\\n    *   **Adaptive γ-MVE:** In the γ-MVE value estimation from Paper 1, the contribution of the model-based rollout is weighted by the confidence. The value is a blend between a full H-step model rollout and a shorter one, controlled by `u_τ`. If `u_τ > q_val`, significantly reduce `H` or increase the weight of the terminal model-free value function `V(s_{t+1})`.\\n    *   **Uncertainty-Guided Exploration:** Provide an intrinsic reward bonus `r_bonus = β * max(0, u_τ - q_val)`. This encourages the agent to take actions that lead to trajectories the model is uncertain about, prompting data collection that reduces model error.\\n\\n**Proposed Experiment Outline:**\\n\\n*   **Environments:**\\n    *   Classic Control: Pendulum, Acrobot, Reacher (low-dim state, focus on dynamics).\\n    *   Non-stationary Control: A Pendulum variant where mass/length changes midway through training to test robustness.\\n    *   Image-based: A MiniGrid or Procgen environment to evaluate scalability using the latent space approach.\\n\\n*   **Models and Agent Framework:**\\n    *   Agent: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with the γ-MVE value estimator from Paper 1.\\n    *   Trajectory Model `M_θ`: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) or Transformer.\\n    *   Latent Encoder `E`: For image tasks, a standard CNN-based VAE encoder.\\n\\n*   **Baselines:**\\n    1.  **Model-Free SAC:** Standard reference for sample efficiency.\\n    2.  **Standard γ-MVE SAC:** The method from Paper 1, using a fixed rollout horizon `H` and no explicit uncertainty handling.\\n    3.  **Ensemble γ-MVE SAC:** An ensemble of `N` γ-models. Uncertainty is the variance of value estimates across the ensemble. This is a strong, common uncertainty baseline.\\n\\n*   **Proposed System (Conf-Traj-MVE SAC):** The SAC agent implementing our proposed conformalized trajectory model and uncertainty mechanisms.\\n\\n*   **Experiment Steps & Metrics:**\\n    1.  **Implementation & Training:** Implement all models. Train them across multiple seeds on all environments.\\n    2.  **Primary Evaluation:**\\n        *   **Sample Efficiency:** Compare learning curves (cumulative reward vs. environment steps). *Primary Success:* Conf-Traj-MVE learns faster than all baselines.\\n        *   **Asymptotic Performance:** Compare final average reward and variance across seeds. *Primary Success:* Conf-Traj-MVE achieves higher/more stable rewards.\\n    3.  **Calibration & Non-stationarity Analysis:**\\n        *   **Calibration Quality:** On a held-out test set of real trajectories, verify that the empirical coverage `(1/N_test) * Σ I(α_i <= q_val)` is close to the target `1-ε_cal`. Compare this to the calibration of the ensemble baseline.\\n        *   **Non-stationarity Test:** In the non-stationary environment, plot the average `u_τ` over time. *Hypothesis:* `u_τ` will spike after the dynamics shift, and the Conf-Traj-MVE agent\\'s performance will dip less and recover faster than baselines.\\n    4.  **Ablation Studies:**\\n        *   Run a 2x2 factorial experiment: (Adaptive γ-MVE on/off) x (Exploration Bonus on/off) to disentangle their contributions.\\n        *   On the image-based task, sweep the latent dimension size `z_dim` (e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64) and report the effect on calibration quality and final performance.\\n\\n**Concrete Example:**\\nConsider an agent in a Reacher task trying to plan a multi-step move.\\n*   **Standard γ-MVE:** The agent imagines an H-step trajectory. If an early step has a small error (e.g., predicting the arm\\'s velocity slightly wrong), this error compounds, and the final predicted position of the arm could be wildly inaccurate. The agent trusts this flawed plan completely.\\n*   **Conf-Traj-MVE:** The agent imagines the same trajectory. It computes the trajectory-level nonconformity score `u_τ`. Because the predicted trajectory diverges significantly from any seen during calibration due to the compounding error, `u_τ` is high (likely `> q_val`).\\n    *   **Adaptive Planning:** The agent recognizes the plan is untrustworthy. It shortens its effective planning horizon, perhaps only trusting the first step of the model and then relying on its model-free value function, leading to a more conservative and safer action.\\n    *   **Exploration:** The high `u_τ` provides an intrinsic reward, encouraging the agent to explore the dynamics of that specific motion, thereby collecting data to fix the model\\'s error.\\n\\n**Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations**\\n*   **Risk 1 – Computational Overhead:** Generating real trajectories for calibration is more expensive than using the model. Calculating `u_τ` at each step adds overhead.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** `D_cal` can be collected periodically in batches, not continuously. The trajectory model `M_θ` is a single model, making it cheaper at inference time than an N-model ensemble, which is our main comparison. The cost of calibration is amortized.\\n*   **Risk 2 – Trajectory Model Quality:** If the trajectory model `M_θ` is fundamentally unable to capture the environment dynamics (e.g., due to insufficient capacity), the uncertainty scores might be less meaningful.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** This is a feature, not a bug. A well-calibrated system should report extremely high uncertainty if the model is misspecified. Our experiments will include analysis to confirm that high `u_τ` correlates with regions of high actual model error, demonstrating this desired behavior.\\n*   **Risk 3 – Stale Calibration Data:** In a continually learning agent, the policy `π` changes, meaning the distribution of states in `D_cal` could become stale.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** The calibration set `D_cal` will be a sliding window of recent real-world trajectories, ensuring it reflects the states the current policy is likely to visit. `q_val` will be re-calculated periodically.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': \"**Dissecting Evaluator Feedback**\\n\\nI'm meticulously dissecting the feedback I received, focusing on areas of disagreement and common themes. The first pass is done, and the next step involves categorizing the critiques by their underlying assumptions. I'm mapping the feedback to specific sections of the initial proposal.\\n\\n\\n**Prioritizing Reviewer Concerns**\\n\\nI've begun to sift through Evaluator 1's detailed critique, homing in on their primary concern: the calibration target choice. The γ-model rollout strategy for the calibration set is flagged, so I'm now meticulously re-evaluating this core methodological aspect. I'll need a new approach, and I'm considering options to ensure a robust and reliable calibration target.\\n\\n\\n**Evaluating and Responding to Critics**\\n\\nI'm moving forward to synthesize the feedback from both evaluators and formulate actionable changes. I'm zeroing in on the calibration target issue, where Evaluator 1's concern regarding the γ-model self-rollouts is front and center. The idea of integrating a sim-truth or environment-derived dataset is compelling. I am weighing options, and I must consider if these sources are available, as these would change experimental design and data collection.\\n\\n\\n**Analyzing Expert Critique**\\n\\nI'm diving deep into Evaluator 1's comments, focusing on calibration and dimensionality issues. The sim-truth data source for the calibration set is a top priority. I'm now sketching how to integrate low-rank latent summaries, specifically exploring PCA or variational autoencoders (VAEs). The shift towards sequence-based conformal prediction is also a game changer, which will require modifications to the original setup.\\n\\n\\n**Refining Research Focus**\\n\\nI'm now organizing the feedback. My main focus is the calibration target issue and high-dimensional state spaces, both flagged by Evaluator 1. I am changing the calibration set's data source to a high-fidelity simulator or the actual environment. Also, I will reduce dimensionality using techniques like PCA or VAEs, and I'm exploring a sequence-based conformal prediction. Evaluator 2's feedback, including concerns on novelty and uncertainty score definition, is being addressed.\\n\\n\\n**Revising Research Strategy**\\n\\nI'm currently consolidating the feedback received, focusing on the key critiques and actionable changes. The plan is to reconstruct the research proposal, prioritizing alterations to the data source for the calibration set and addressing high-dimensional state spaces. I'm also assessing the trajectory-level conformalization for novelty. The next step will be to finalize the experiment section.\\n\\n\\n**Restructuring the Research Plan**\\n\\nI'm now actively restructuring the original research idea. My primary focus involves transitioning from single-state predictions to trajectory-level predictions, a critical shift. Simultaneously, I'm modifying the calibration process to use the real environment or a high-fidelity simulator to generate data. Also, I must incorporate low-dimensional latent summaries.\\n\\n\\n**Restructuring the Plan**\\n\\nI'm now constructing a revised research approach, based on the feedback provided. I'm now focusing on the transition from single-state predictions to trajectory-level predictions, which provides a significant novelty improvement. I am focusing on the calibration set construction method, using high-fidelity simulators or the actual environment for robust and reliable data, and also incorporating low-dimensional latent summaries to address issues related to dimensionality. Additionally, the research will feature an advanced uncertainty score definition.\\n\\n\\n**Revising for Expert Feedback**\\n\\nI've processed the feedback. The core change will be shifting single-state predictions to trajectory-level. The calibration data will originate from the real environment, and I'll use latent summarization. Also, I'll refine the uncertainty score definition using nonconformity. The experimental section needs a major overhaul, incorporating more tests.\\n\\n\\n\"}}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 52229, 'completion_tokens': 7366, 'total_tokens': 59595}}\n",

            "Infinite-horizon world models like γ-models (Paper 1) offer a sample-efficient way to learn long-term environment dynamics. However, they typically provide a single distributional prediction without a measure of confidence. When these models make multi-step predictions (rollouts), small initial prediction errors can compound over the horizon, leading to catastrophically wrong future-state predictions. Current methods lack a principled, computationally-efficient way to quantify the model's uncertainty about an entire predicted *trajectory*, making it difficult for an RL agent to know when to distrust a long-term plan.\n",

            "Model-based RL agents that rely on multi-step rollouts are highly vulnerable to compounding prediction errors. Existing world models do not provide reliable, calibrated estimates of their own epistemic uncertainty over entire predicted trajectories. This prevents the agent from dynamically assessing the trustworthiness of its imagined plans.\n",

            "*   *Consequence:* Agents may over-trust their world model's long-term plans, especially in novel or poorly-learned regions of the state space. This leads to brittle policies, sub-optimal decision-making, and an inability to safely navigate environments where model inaccuracies can lead to failure.\n",

            "**Motivation:**\n",
            "Paper 1 introduced γ-models, a powerful framework for infinite-horizon prediction. Its value-expansion method (γ-MVE) relies on model rollouts, which are susceptible to compounding error. Paper 2 demonstrates how Conformal Prediction (CP) can provide rigorous, calibrated uncertainty guarantees for complex models in robotics, particularly by disentangling different sources of uncertainty.\n",
            "\n",
            "This research builds on these ideas by proposing a novel framework to **conformalize trajectory predictions** from a world model. Instead of applying CP to a single future state, we apply it to entire multi-step trajectories. This approach directly addresses the compounding error problem by measuring the model's uncertainty over a whole sequence of states. A nonconformity score will measure the divergence between a predicted trajectory and a ground-truth trajectory, capturing how errors accumulate over time.\n",

If the model is already mis-calibrated, the calibration set may inherit that bias.\"\\n    *   Evaluator 2: \"Calibration procedure relies on sampling from target γ-model distributions, which may introduce bias if the target model is itself inaccurate.\"\\n    *   Related Question (Eval 2): \"How sensitive is the method to the quality of the target γ-model used for generating calibration data? Could poor target models lead to miscalibrated uncertainty estimates?\"\\n\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** This is the most critical technical flaw in the original proposal. The calibration process is circular and unsound. I must break this dependency. The \"ground truth\" for calibration must come from a source independent of the model being calibrated. The only truly reliable source is the environment itself.\\n\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will completely change Step 2 of the \"Proposed Method\" (\"Collect Calibration Data\").\\n    2.  Instead of sampling `s_e_i^{true}` from the target γ-model `µ_θ_s`, the new procedure will be: For each calibration data point, take a state-action pair `(s_t, a_t)` from the replay buffer. Then, execute the current policy `π` in the **actual environment** to generate a true future state `s_e^{true}`.\\n    3.  To properly sample from the discounted state occupancy, I will simulate the process described in Paper 1 (Sec. 4). I\\'ll sample a future timestep `Δt` from a geometric distribution `Geom(1-γ)`. Then, I will execute a rollout of the policy in the real environment for `Δt` steps to obtain the true future state `s_{t+Δt}`. This state will serve as `s_e_i^{true}`.\\n    4.  This change completely removes the bias issue, making the calibration process sound. It also renders the question of sensitivity to the target γ-model\\'s quality moot for the calibration step. The new dependency is on the quality of the real-world data, which is the correct dependency to have.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Section 2: Novelty and Scope (Single-State vs. Trajectory)**\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   Evaluator 1 (Novelty suggestion): \"Novelty - treat state-action trajectories as sets and conformalize sequence likelihood instead of single-step s_e. Captures temporal compounding error, not just local mismatch.\"\\n    *   Evaluator 2 (Weakness): \"Limited novelty - primarily a combination of existing techniques rather than fundamental algorithmic innovation.\"\\n\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** Both reviewers correctly identified that combining CP and γ-models for single states is a straightforward, incremental step. The suggestion to move to the trajectory level is excellent, as it directly addresses the core problem of compounding errors in model-based RL and significantly boosts the idea\\'s novelty and impact.\\n\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will re-architect the entire proposal around **trajectory-level uncertainty**.\\n    2.  **Title & Hypothesis:** The title, hypothesis, and motivation will be updated to reflect this focus on *trajectory prediction* and *compounding error*.\\n    3.  **Proposed Method:**\\n        *   The world model will be redefined from a simple conditional Normalizing Flow for `s_e` to an **autoregressive latent model** that, given `(z_t, a_{t:t+H-1})`, predicts a latent trajectory `ẑ_{t+1:t+H}`. This is a more powerful type of world model, but it\\'s a natural fit for this problem.\\n        *   The **nonconformity score** will be redefined. Instead of a single log-likelihood, it will be a trajectory-level error metric. A simple and effective choice is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted latent trajectory and the true latent trajectory (obtained from an environment rollout and encoded): `α_i = (1/H) * Σ_{k=1..H} || z_{t_i+k}^{true} - ẑ_{t_i+k} ||^2`. This directly measures the model\\'s multi-step predictive accuracy.\\n    4.  This pivot transforms the idea from \"applying Method B to Method A\" into a genuinely new approach for a harder and more relevant problem in world models.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Section 3: Scalability to High-Dimensional State Spaces**\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   Evaluator 1 (Feasibility suggestion): \"pre-compute low-rank latent summaries so CP runs on 8-D summaries, sidestepping curse-of-dimensionality. Keeps conformal region calculation tractable as you move to image-based tasks.\"\\n    *   Evaluator 2 (Weakness): \"Experimental validation focuses on relatively simple control environments - scalability to high-dimensional problems unclear.\"\\n    *   Related Question (Eval 1): \"Scalability to images? MiniGrid-RGB task; freeze CNN encoder, apply CP on 32-D latent flow; run the same coverage tests.\"\\n\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The original idea implicitly assumes a low-dimensional state space. I need to explicitly define how the method will handle high-dimensional inputs like images, where direct application of CP is infeasible.\\n\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will integrate a **dimensionality reduction** step at the beginning of the \"Proposed Method\". I will specify training a variational autoencoder (VAE) or a similar representation learning model to learn an encoder `E: S -> Z` that maps high-dimensional states `s` (like images) to a low-dimensional latent space `z`.\\n    2.  The entire process—the autoregressive world model, the nonconformity score calculation, and the conformalization—will operate within this compact latent space `Z`.\\n    3.  The \"Proposed Experiment Outline\" will be updated to include an image-based environment (e.g., MiniGrid or a Procgen level) to validate this approach.\\n    4.  I will also add an ablation study as suggested, sweeping the latent dimension size (`z_dim`) to analyze its effect on calibration and performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Section 4: Uncertainty Score Formulation**\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   Evaluator 2: \"The uncertainty score definition (1 - p_inside) lacks theoretical justification - unclear why this specific formulation is optimal.\"\\n    *   Related Question (Eval 2): \"What is the theoretical justification for using (1 - p_inside) as the uncertainty score?\"\\n\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The `1 - p_inside` metric is heuristic and overly complex, especially in the new trajectory-based framework. I need a simpler, more direct, and justifiable uncertainty score.\\n\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  With the shift to trajectory-level error as the nonconformity score, I have a very natural candidate for the uncertainty score.\\n    2.  I will define the uncertainty score `u_γ` for a new trajectory prediction simply as its **nonconformity score**: `u_γ(z_t, a_{t:t+H-1}) = (1/H) * Σ_{k=1..H} || E(s_{t+k}) - ẑ_{t+k} ||^2`, where `s_{t+k}` are states from a *model-based* rollout and `ẑ_{t+k}` is the model\\'s single best guess for the latent trajectory. This score directly represents the expected one-step prediction error of the model over the imagined rollout.\\n    3.  This definition is more principled: it\\'s a direct measure of the model\\'s own predicted error magnitude, which is a very intuitive form of uncertainty. It\\'s also computationally cheaper than the original `1-p_inside` score as it doesn\\'t require sampling. I\\'ll use the *conformal quantile `q_val`* as a threshold to decide if the uncertainty is \"high\" or \"low\", but the uncertainty value itself will be the raw error score.\\n    4.  Alternatively, the uncertainty score can be the *size* of the conformal prediction set itself. I will settle on using the non-conformity score as it\\'s more granular.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Section 5: Experimental Rigor and Baselines**\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   Eval 2 Question: \"How does this approach compare to ensemble-based or Bayesian approaches for uncertainty quantification...?\"\\n    *   Unanswered Questions (Eval 1): \"Will adaptive γ-MVE improve or destabilize SAC?\", \"Exploration bonus or value-penalization—which drives more sample efficiency?\", \"How does the method perform when the environment exhibits non-stationarity...?\"\\n\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The experimental plan needs to be more comprehensive to rigorously prove the hypothesis and answer the reviewers\\' specific questions. This means stronger baselines and more targeted experiments.\\n\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  **Baselines:** I will add a strong uncertainty-aware baseline: **Ensemble γ-MVE SAC**. This involves training an ensemble of γ-models and using the variance of their predictions as the uncertainty score. This is a standard and powerful technique, making the comparison more meaningful.\\n    2.  **Targeted Experiments:** I will add two new experimental settings to the outline:\\n        *   **Non-Stationary Environment:** A Pendulum variant where mass or length changes mid-training. This directly tests the agent\\'s robustness and ability to detect and adapt to distribution shifts using the uncertainty signal.\\n        *   **Model Misspecification:** I\\'ll run a test where the latent space dimension `z_dim` is deliberately made too small to fully capture the environment dynamics. The goal is to show that `u_γ` correctly identifies the resulting high model error.\\n    3.  **Ablation Studies:** I will keep the factorial experiment design to disentangle the effects of using uncertainty for planning (adaptive γ-MVE) vs. exploration (intrinsic bonus). This directly answers the reviewers\\' questions about the mechanism of improvement.\\n\\n*   **Feedback I will not address:**\\n    *   Evaluator 1\\'s \"Audacity\" suggestion to \"publish a YouTube demo\" on a real robot is excellent for motivation and future work, but I will keep the core proposal focused on simulation-based experiments for feasibility. I\\'ll mention this in the motivation or discussion as a long-term vision.\\n\\nBy implementing these changes, the revised idea will be more novel, technically sound, scalable, and experimentally rigorous, directly addressing all major criticisms from the evaluators.\\n\\n</REVISED IDEA>\\n## Generated Research Idea\\n\\n**Title:** Conformalized Trajectory Models: Calibrated Uncertainty for Mitigating Compounding Errors in Model-Based RL\\n\\n**Observed Phenomenon**\\nWorld models in Reinforcement Learning (RL), such as the γ-model (Paper 1), learn environmental dynamics to enable planning. When used to predict long sequences of future states (rollouts), small initial prediction errors invariably compound, leading to imagined trajectories that diverge significantly from reality. While these models can represent environmental stochasticity (aleatoric uncertainty), they lack a reliable mechanism to quantify their own confidence in an entire multi-step rollout, especially when critical visual or physical details are lost in the latent state compression.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nCurrent long-horizon world models can generate imagined future trajectories but cannot provide a statistically calibrated measure of uncertainty for these multi-step predictions. This leads to an \"overconfidence\" problem, where an agent cannot distinguish between a reliable imagined future and one that has spiraled into nonsense due to compounding errors.\\n\\n*   **Condition:** We lack a principled, computationally efficient method to produce calibrated epistemic uncertainty estimates for *entire predicted trajectories* from a generative world model.\\n*   **Consequence:** Agents blindly trust their model rollouts, even when they are inaccurate. This leads to sub-optimal, and potentially unsafe, planning, inefficient exploration, and an inability to recover from the loss of crucial information (e.g., subtle visual cues) that the model failed to capture in its latent space.\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\nPaper 1 (\"Generative Temporal Difference Learning\") introduced the γ-model, a powerful framework for infinite-horizon prediction that elegantly combines model-based and model-free ideas. However, its utility is limited by the problem of compounding errors during multi-step rollouts. Paper 2 (\"Know Where You’re Uncertain\") demonstrates how to formally disentangle and quantify uncertainty in complex models using Conformal Prediction (CP), providing rigorous, distribution-free guarantees.\\n\\nThis research builds upon these ideas by proposing a novel method to directly tackle the compounding error problem. Instead of calibrating single-state predictions, we propose to **conformalize the entire trajectory prediction process**. By treating a multi-step rollout as a single data point, we can use CP to generate a calibrated uncertainty score for the whole sequence. This score reflects the model\\'s confidence in its own ability to chain predictions together accurately. An RL agent can then use this trajectory-level uncertainty to:\\n1.  **Safely plan:** Dynamically adjust how much it trusts a long model-based rollout (e.g., in a γ-MVE framework from Paper 1) based on its holistic uncertainty.\\n2.  **Explore efficiently:** Drive exploration towards regions where the model\\'s ability to predict *sequences of events* is poor, not just where single-state predictions are uncertain.\\n\\nThis approach is fundamentally more novel and powerful than single-state calibration because it directly confronts the temporal nature of compounding errors, creating a world model that \"knows when its imagination is running wild.\"\\n\\n**Hypothesis**\\nIntegrating trajectory-level Conformal Prediction with a latent autoregressive world model will produce calibrated uncertainty scores that reflect compounding prediction error. RL agents using this trajectory uncertainty for adaptive planning and guided exploration will be more robust, sample-efficient, and achieve higher asymptotic performance than agents using standard world models or ensemble-based uncertainty methods, especially in complex environments or under non-stationarity.\\n\\n**Proposed Method:**\\nThe core idea is to train a latent trajectory model, then calibrate it using trajectory-level Conformal Prediction.\\n\\n1.  **Learn a Latent State Representation (for high-dim inputs):** For image-based environments, first train a VAE-style model to learn an encoder `E: S -> Z` and decoder `D: Z -> S` mapping high-dimensional states `s` to a low-dimensional latent space `z`. Subsequent steps operate on `z`.\\n\\n2.  **Train an Autoregressive Trajectory Model (`f_θ`):** Train a latent dynamics model `f_θ(z_{t+1} | z_t, a_t)` that predicts the next latent state. This model can be used autoregressively to generate a trajectory of length H: `ẑ_{t+1:t+H} = (ẑ_{t+1}, ..., ẑ_{t+H})` by repeatedly applying `f_θ`. This is our world model.\\n\\n3.  **Collect Calibration Data (`D_cal`):** Create a calibration dataset of true trajectories `D_cal = { ( (z_{t_i}, a_{t_i:t_i+H-1}), z_{t_i+1:t_i+H}^{true} ) }_{i=1}^{N_cal}`. This set must be from a hold-out set, separate from the model training data.\\n    *   For each entry: Sample a state `s_t` and a sequence of actions `a_{t:t+H-1}` from a replay buffer.\\n    *   From `s_t`, execute the action sequence `a_{t:t+H-1}` **in the actual environment** to collect the true state sequence `s_{t+1:t+H}^{true}`.\\n    *   Encode the true trajectory into the latent space using the encoder `E` to get `z_{t+1:t+H}^{true}`. This use of the real environment is crucial to avoid the calibration bias identified by the reviewers.\\n\\n4.  **Calculate Trajectory-Level Nonconformity Scores (`α_i`):** For each calibration tuple, generate the model\\'s predicted trajectory `ẑ_{t_i+1:t_i+H}` starting from `z_{t_i}`. The nonconformity score is the mean squared error over the trajectory:\\n    `α_i = (1/H) * Σ_{k=1 to H} || z_{t_i+k}^{true} - ẑ_{t_i+k} ||^2`.\\n    A high `α_i` means the entire predicted trajectory was inaccurate, indicating high nonconformity.\\n\\n5.  **Determine Conformal Quantile (`q_val`):** Given a desired marginal miscoverage rate `ε_cal` (e.g., 0.1), `q_val` is the score at the `ceil((N_cal+1)(1-ε_cal)) / N_cal`-th empirical quantile of the sorted `α_i` scores. Any predicted trajectory with an error greater than `q_val` is considered \"out of calibration.\"\\n\\n6.  **Uncertainty-Aware Prediction and Score (`u_τ`):** At test time, for a query `(s_t, a_{t:t+H-1})`:\\n    *   Encode `s_t` to `z_t` and generate the imagined latent trajectory `ẑ_{t+1:t+H}`.\\n    *   The **trajectory uncertainty score `u_τ(s_t, a_{t:t+H-1})` is defined as the predicted trajectory error**: we cannot compute the true error, so we use the model\\'s one-step prediction error, summed over the rollout: `u_τ = (1/H) * Σ_{k=0 to H-1} || f_θ(ẑ_{t+k}, a_{t+k}) - ẑ_{t+k+1} ||^2`, where `ẑ_t=z_t`. This is a measure of the model\\'s internal disagreement during the rollout. A simpler and more direct approach is to use the size of the conformal set itself, which can be approximated. We propose to use the model\\'s self-predicted error as the score.\\n\\n7.  **Utilize Uncertainty (`u_τ`) in RL Agent:**\\n    *   **Adaptive Planning (γ-MVE style):** The value estimate from an H-step model rollout depends on the reliability of that rollout. We will use `u_τ` to modulate the trust in the rollout. If `u_τ` exceeds a threshold (e.g., based on `q_val`), the agent should shorten its effective planning horizon `H` or increase the weight of a terminal model-free value function, making the plan more conservative.\\n    *   **Uncertainty-Guided Exploration:** Use `u_τ` as an intrinsic reward bonus `r_bonus = β * u_τ`. This encourages the agent to explore state-action sequences where its trajectory model is uncertain, directly targeting the reduction of compounding error.\\n\\n**Proposed Experiment Outline:**\\n*   **Environments:**\\n    *   Standard continuous control (Pendulum, Reacher) to validate the core mechanics.\\n    *   Image-based environment (e.g., MiniGrid-KeyCorridor) where the world model operates on VAE latents, to test scalability and handling of crucial visual information.\\n    *   **Non-stationary Control:** A Pendulum variant where mass/length changes midway through training to test robustness to distribution shift.\\n\\n*   **Models and Agent Framework:**\\n    *   **Agent:** Soft Actor-Critic (SAC).\\n    *   **World Model:** Autoregressive model on VAE latents.\\n    *   **Value Estimation:** H-step model-based value expansion, similar in spirit to γ-MVE from Paper 1.\\n\\n*   **Baselines:**\\n    1.  **Standard Model-Based SAC:** The agent using H-step rollouts without any uncertainty quantification.\\n    2.  **Model-Free SAC:** Purely model-free agent (for sample efficiency reference).\\n    3.  **Ensemble-Model SAC:** A strong baseline using an ensemble of trajectory models. Uncertainty is the variance across the ensemble\\'s trajectory predictions.\\n\\n*   **Proposed System (Conf-Traj-SAC):** The SAC agent using the conformalized trajectory model and uncertainty mechanisms described above.\\n\\n*   **Experiment Steps & Ablations:**\\n    1.  Train and evaluate all baselines and the proposed system on all environments.\\n    2.  **Factorial Ablation:** Test the contribution of each uncertainty use-case: (a) Planning only, (b) Exploration only, (c) Both.\\n    3.  **Sensitivity Analysis:** Sweep the latent dimension size `z_dim` (e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64) and measure the impact on calibration quality and final performance.\\n    4.  **Calibration Verification:** On a held-out test set of true trajectories, verify that the conformal prediction sets achieve the target coverage `1 - ε_cal`.\\n    5.  **Model Misspecification Test:** On the image-based task, deliberately use a small `z_dim` and verify that `u_τ` correctly identifies the high model error.\\n\\n*   **Metrics & Success Criteria:**\\n    *   **Primary:** Improved sample efficiency (learning curve) and higher/more stable asymptotic reward compared to all baselines.\\n    *   **Secondary:** Empirical coverage of the conformal sets. Correlation between `u_τ` and actual trajectory prediction error. Qualitative analysis of exploration patterns and planning behavior.\\n\\n**Concrete Example:**\\nConsider MiniGrid-KeyCorridor. The agent sees an image `s_t` of a corridor. It needs to pick up a key and open a door.\\n*   **Standard Trajectory Model:** The agent plans an H-step action sequence: \"go forward, turn, pick up, go to door\". The model `f_θ` generates a latent trajectory `ẑ_{t+1:t+H}`. If the model\\'s latent space poorly represents the \"key color\" or \"door locked\" status, the imagined trajectory might show the agent going through the door, even if it doesn\\'t have the right key.

The `D_cal` dataset can be built up over time and reused. The key is that `q_val` does not need to be updated on every agent step.\\n*   **Risk 2 – Policy-Dependent Calibration:** The calibration data `D_cal` is generated using the current policy `π`, meaning the calibration is specific to that policy\\'s data distribution.\\n    *   **Fallback:** This is an inherent property of online learning. We can mitigate this by ensuring the replay buffer for calibration contains data from a mix of past policies or by using an exploratory policy (e.g., with added noise) specifically for calibration data collection.\\n*   **Risk 3 – Complexity of Trajectory Model:** An autoregressive latent model is more complex to train and tune than the original γ-model.\\n    *   **Fallback:** We will start with standard and well-understood architectures for latent dynamics models (e.g., based on PlaNet or DreamerV2) and leverage existing best practices for stable training.

The goal is to pinpoint specific issues raised by the evaluators. This means carefully analyzing their comments, looking for key points and areas of disagreement. It’s a meticulous process, but crucial for a good revision.\\n\\n\\n**Deconstructing the Feedback**\\n\\nI\\'ve started analyzing the feedback, focusing on the first evaluator\\'s critique of the calibration target. The circular dependency issue is now clear. My plan is to replace the model\\'s self-generated samples with real-world environment rollouts to get the \"true\" future states. This is a significant shift in the data collection process. I need to think about how this change will impact the overall methodology.\\n\\n\\n**Refining the Solution**\\n\\nI\\'m now focused on the implications of using real-world rollouts to calibrate the model. This presents challenges for data collection, especially in complex environments. Specifically, I\\'m investigating the optimal sampling strategy for these rollouts, ensuring they accurately reflect the discounted occupancy distribution. Furthermore, I\\'m evaluating how the dimensionality reduction step impacts the overall model accuracy. The plan now includes exploring different encoder architectures and latent space sizes to find the best trade-off.\\n\\n\\n**Revising the Approach**\\n\\nI\\'m now working on implementing the changes suggested by the first evaluator. Replacing the self-generated samples with real-world environment rollouts is the first priority, and I\\'m considering how the sampling should be handled. I\\'m also considering the dimensionality reduction strategy to be deployed before the conformal predictor, to tackle the issue of high-dimensional input states.\\n\\n\\n**Evaluating Trajectories**\\n\\nI\\'m now focused on reformulating the nonconformity score. The key idea is to move from single-state predictions to trajectory predictions. This will involve redefining the error metric to assess the divergence between real and imagined trajectories, perhaps using a latent space representation. The challenge lies in adapting the model to generate these trajectory predictions and devising a suitable score for the entire imagined path. I am still considering different scoring functions and how to integrate them into the existing conformal prediction framework.\\n\\n\\n**Evaluating the Error Metrics**\\n\\nI\\'m now focused on the choice of error metrics for the trajectory-level CP. The core challenge is defining what constitutes a \"good\" imagined trajectory. This involves investigating different trajectory comparison techniques in the latent space and integrating them into the nonconformity score. Currently, I\\'m exploring how to incorporate a suitable error metric, such as the Mean Squared Error, between real and imagined trajectories within the conformal prediction framework. The plan includes an updated evaluation of the nonconformity score and the use of different model architectures to provide better state trajectories.\\n\\n\\n**Analyzing the Criticisms**\\n\\nI\\'m now processing the feedback received from both evaluators. The most critical issue highlighted is the circular dependency problem and the need to use real environment rollouts. I\\'m also focused on how to transform the method to incorporate trajectory-level conformal prediction, which would require updating the existing error metrics. This is the most important step.\\n\\n\\n**Revising the Methodology**\\n\\nI\\'m now in the process of reshaping the core methodology. The focus has shifted to trajectory-level predictions, which requires updating the nonconformity score, error metrics, and overall model design. I\\'m considering different scoring functions and integrating them into the CP framework to better capture trajectory uncertainty. This will require a substantial shift in how the model is structured.\\n\\n\\n**Restructuring the Response**\\n\\nI\\'m now starting to rewrite the sections to address the evaluator\\'s concerns, particularly the core issue of the circular dependency. The plan is to replace the original calibration method with a process involving real environment rollouts for generating the \"true\" future states. I\\'m also re-evaluating the uncertainty score to reflect the new trajectory-level approach.\\n\\n\\n**Evaluating the Feedback**\\n\\nI\\'m now carefully analyzing the feedback provided by the evaluators. The focus is to identify the most critical issues, like the circular dependency in the initial calibration process. I\\'m breaking down each point and strategizing on how to address them effectively in the revised manuscript.\\n\\n\\n**Reflecting on the Plan**\\n\\nI\\'m now mapping out the steps to address the evaluator\\'s points. The core challenge is creating trajectory predictions, which will require modifications to the γ-model. The real environment rollout will replace the model\\'s internal samples.

When used to predict long sequences of future states (rollouts), small initial prediction errors invariably compound, leading to imagined trajectories that diverge significantly from reality.

            "This research builds upon these ideas by proposing a novel method to directly tackle the compounding error problem. Instead of calibrating single-state predictions, we propose to **conformalize the entire trajectory prediction process**.

Try latent-only training with a perceptual-reconstruction term ‖f_VLM(x)-f_VLM(x̂)‖.\"\\n    -   Evaluator 2: \"Limited novelty - essentially adds an auxiliary prediction head to existing world models\"\\n\\n-   **Identify what needs to change:** The original idea of adding an auxiliary loss `L_semantic` is perceived as an incremental improvement rather than a novel contribution. The core methodology needs to be strengthened to be more distinct from prior work.\\n\\n-   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** I will restructure the proposed method to present two variants of SALVO, directly addressing the feedback:\\n    1.  **SALVO-Aux (original idea):** This will be framed as the foundational, more direct version where `L_semantic` is an auxiliary loss. This is a direct test of the initial hypothesis.\\n    2.  **SALVO-Recon (new, more novel idea):** I will introduce a more advanced, reconstruction-free variant inspired by Evaluator 1\\'s suggestion. Here, the traditional pixel-based reconstruction loss (`L_recon`) is *replaced* with a semantic reconstruction loss in the VLM\\'s feature space: `L_semantic_recon = ||sg(f_VLM(x_t)) - f_VLM(p_ϕ(x̂_t | s_t))||^2`. This significantly increases novelty by moving towards reconstruction-free world models, which is a key research direction. It also elegantly sidesteps the need for the `g_sem` predictor network, addressing concerns about extra parameters. This modification will be highlighted in the `Proposed Method` and `Motivation` sections.\\n\\n### Section 2: Evaluation Rigor & Proving the Hypothesis\\n\\n-   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    -   Evaluator 1: \"Evaluation Rigor: What external metric demonstrates richer semantics? Ask a held-out VQA model questions about reconstructed frames.\"\\n    -   Evaluator 1: \"Risk Mitigation: How will you know if β is too large? Plot dynamics-prediction error vs β\"\\n    -   Evaluator 1: \"Will VLM-aligned latents still respect accurate physics? Compare rollout prediction error (pixels & proprioception) against Dreamer at β ∈ {0, 0.1, 1}.\"\\n    -   Evaluator 2: \"The connection between better VLM embedding prediction and improved control performance is assumed rather than rigorously established\"\\n\\n-   **Identify what needs to change:** The original experiment outline was sound but lacked specific, creative metrics to directly test the core claims about semantic richness and the potential negative impact on dynamics. The evaluation plan needs to become more sophisticated and targeted.\\n\\n-   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** I will heavily revise the `Proposed Experiment Outline` to include new, dedicated evaluation phases:\\n    1.  **Semantic Richness Analysis:** I will add a new quantitative metric based on Evaluator 1\\'s suggestion: \"VQA on Reconstructions.\" This involves using a pre-trained VQA model to ask semantic questions about the original frames vs. the frames reconstructed by SALVO and the baselines. Higher VQA accuracy on SALVO\\'s reconstructions would provide strong, direct evidence of superior semantic preservation.\\n    2.  **Dynamics Fidelity Analysis:** I will explicitly add an experiment to measure the trade-off between semantics and physics. As suggested, I will plot the long-term rollout prediction error (both pixel-wise MSE and latent-space error, similar to the analysis in *Dreamer*, Paper 2, Fig. 5) as a function of the semantic loss weight `β`. This directly confronts the primary risk of the approach.\\n    3.  **Generalization Test:** I will incorporate the suggestion to \"Evaluate on zero-shot prompts describing styles absent from training clips\" to provide a rigorous test of generalization beyond the training distribution\\'s implicit semantics.\\n\\n### Section 3: Baselines, Ablations, and Fair Comparison\\n\\n-   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    -   Evaluator 1: \"Are improvements due to extra parameters? Keep parameter count fixed: replace decoder MLP with g_sem + lightweight decoder.\"\\n    -   Evaluator 2: \"Have you considered other forms of semantic alignment beyond MSE loss (e.g., contrastive learning, mutual information)?\"\\n\\n-   **Identify what needs to change:** The experimental design needs to ensure that performance gains are not simply due to a larger model and should explore alternative design choices for the core mechanism.\\n\\n-   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  **Parameter Control:** In the `Proposed Experiment Outline`, I will add a clause on ensuring fair comparison by keeping the total parameter count of SALVO-Aux comparable to the GenRL baseline. The suggestion from Evaluator 1 (trading decoder parameters for `g_sem` parameters) will be mentioned as the specific strategy. For SALVO-Recon, this is less of an issue as it *removes* `g_sem` entirely.\\n    2.  **Ablation Studies:** I will expand the ablation studies section. Specifically, I will add an ablation comparing the predictive MSE-based `L_semantic` with a contrastive loss alternative. This shows a deeper exploration of the design space.\\n\\n### Section 4: Feasibility and Computational Cost\\n\\n-   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    -   Evaluator 1: \"More Feasible: Where can you reuse existing data to offset compute? Pre-compute InternVideo2 embeddings once; share across tasks and ablations.\"\\n    -   Evaluator 2: \"Computational overhead concerns are not adequately quantified or addressed\"\\n\\n-   **Identify what needs to change:** The proposal needs to be more explicit and practical about managing the computational load introduced by using a large VLM.\\n\\n-   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:** I will update the `Proposed Method` and `Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations` to be more concrete. I will explicitly state that the target VLM embeddings `f_VLM(x_t)` for the training dataset are pre-computed offline and stored. This removes the VLM forward pass from the main training loop for SALVO-Aux, making the overhead minimal (just the small `g_sem` MLP). For SALVO-Recon, I will acknowledge the higher cost of passing reconstructed images through the VLM but frame it as a trade-off for its potential benefits and novelty.\\n\\n### Section 5: Positioning and Motivation\\n\\n-   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    -   Evaluator 1: \"The idea lives in a crowded space... To stand out you must prove a clear win over these alignment-only baselines and show that semantic regularisation does not hurt dynamics fidelity.\"\\n    -   Evaluator 2: \"Lacks strong theoretical justification for why predicting VLM embeddings should improve downstream task performance\"\\n\\n-   **Identify what needs to change:** The `Problem Statement` and `Motivation` need to be sharpened to more clearly articulate the unique contribution and the core intuition behind the method.\\n\\n-   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  In the `Problem Statement` and `Motivation`, I will strengthen the argument against post-hoc alignment (the GenRL approach). I will argue that a world model trained on reconstruction alone may perform *irreversible compression*, discarding the very subtle visual cues that a VLM uses to define a task. Post-hoc alignment cannot recover this lost information. SALVO\\'s premise is that by guiding the representation learning *a priori*, the latent space becomes fundamentally more suitable for VLM-based control.\\n    2.  I will explicitly state that the work is empirical and does not offer a formal theoretical proof, but will strengthen the core intuition: by forcing the latent state `s_t` to be predictive of the VLM embedding, we enforce an \"information bottleneck\" that must preserve VLM-salient features, leading to a more useful world model for VLM-guided tasks.\\n\\n### Non-Pertinent Feedback\\n\\n-   **Quote:** Evaluator 1: \"More Audacious: Could the same latent support bidirectional language ↔ action dialogue? Train text→latent and latent→text heads; let ChatGPT critique imagined futures.\"\\n-   **Reasoning:** This is an excellent idea but constitutes a significant expansion of the project scope, likely a full follow-up paper. It moves from VLM-guided control to generative language interaction. I will add this as a compelling `Future Work` direction in the `Discussion` section of a full paper, but exclude it from the core proposal to maintain focus and feasibility.\\n\\n<REVISED IDEA>\\n\\n## Generated Research Idea\\n\\n**Title:** SALVO: Semantically-Aligned World Models via VLM-Guided Latent Space Shaping\\n\\n**Observed Phenomenon**\\nGenerative world models like DreamerV3 and GenRL have shown great success by learning compact latent representations of high-dimensional environments. GenRL, in particular, demonstrates how to steer these agents with Vision-Language Model (VLM) prompts by learning a \"connector\" between the VLM\\'s embedding space and the world model\\'s pre-trained latent space. However, the world model itself is trained on objectives like pixel reconstruction, which are agnostic to the rich semantic content that VLMs capture. There is no guarantee that the subtle visual details distinguishing \"a graceful walk\" from \"a normal walk\"—details a VLM is sensitive to—are preserved in the latent space.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nCurrent generative world models learn latent representations that are not intrinsically shaped by the semantic understanding of large VLMs. The training objectives prioritize physical and pixel-level predictability, which can lead to an \"irreversible compression\" where semantically crucial but visually subtle details are discarded.\\n\\n*   *Condition:* We don’t yet have world models whose latent representations are fundamentally regularized by VLM semantics during their own training. Latent state learning is decoupled from the rich semantic space used for high-level task specification.\\n*   *Consequence:* This decoupling forces post-hoc alignment mechanisms (like GenRL\\'s connector) to map complex linguistic/visual concepts onto a latent space that may be impoverished or simply lack the necessary information. This limits the agent\\'s ability to perform tasks that hinge on nuanced visual understanding, hurts generalization to prompts requiring fine-grained distinctions, and makes the learned world model a less faithful simulator for complex, VLM-specified goals.\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\nState-of-the-art methods like *Dream to Control* (Paper 2) build world models that excel at predicting environment dynamics. GenRL (Paper 1) brilliantly leverages these models for language-guided tasks by training a connector module *after* the world model is trained. This post-hoc approach, however, has a critical weakness: if the world model\\'s encoder, optimized for reconstruction, has already discarded the visual information that distinguishes \"running\" from \"sprinting with determination\", no connector can magically recover it.\\n\\nSALVO is motivated by the need to infuse semantic awareness directly into the heart of the world model: its representation learning. Instead of treating the world model and VLM as separate entities to be bridged later, we propose to use the VLM\\'s semantic interpretation of the world as a guiding signal *during* the world model\\'s training. By compelling the model\\'s latent states to encode information that a VLM deems important, we hypothesize the resulting latent space will be far better conditioned for VLM-guided control. This should result in a more accurate internal model of the world for semantically complex tasks, simplifying the policy learning challenge and enabling better generalization. Our approach aims to create a world model that not only knows *what* the world looks like, but has a V-LM-aligned understanding of *what it means*.\\n\\n**Hypothesis**\\nTraining a generative world model with an objective that forces its latent states to be predictive of, or reconstructable into, a pre-trained VLM\\'s vision embedding will result in a world model that:\\n1.  Learns a more semantically meaningful and detailed latent representation that better preserves task-relevant visual nuances.\\n2.  Enables an agent to achieve higher performance and sample efficiency on downstream tasks specified by VLM prompts.\\n3.  Demonstrates superior zero-shot generalization to novel prompts describing behaviors and styles not seen in the training data, compared to models trained without this semantic alignment.\\n\\n**Proposed Method:**\\nSALVO enhances a Dreamer-style world model by injecting semantic guidance from a frozen, pre-trained VLM (e.g., InternVideo2) during the world model\\'s training phase. The base architecture includes an Encoder `q_ϕ(s_t|x_t)`, a Dynamics Predictor, and a Decoder `p_ϕ(x̂_t|s_t)`. We propose two variants:\\n\\n**1. SALVO-Aux: Semantic Guidance as an Auxiliary Loss**\\nThis method adds a direct semantic regularizer to the standard world model training objective.\\n*   **Semantic Alignment Module:** A lightweight MLP, `g_sem(s_t)`, is introduced to predict the VLM\\'s vision embedding `e_v(x_t) = f_VLM(x_t)` from the latent state `s_t`.\\n*   **Training Objective:** The world model and `g_sem` are trained with a composite loss:\\n    `L_WM = L_recon + L_dyn + β * L_semantic`\\n    where `L_recon` and `L_dyn` are the standard reconstruction and dynamics losses from GenRL/Dreamer, and the new semantic loss is:\\n    `L_semantic = || sg(f_VLM(x_t)) - g_sem(s_t) ||^2`\\n    Gradients from `L_semantic` flow back through `g_sem` and, crucially, the world model\\'s encoder `q_ϕ`, shaping the latent state `s_t`.\\n\\n**2. SALVO-Recon: Semantic Guidance as the Reconstruction Target (More Novel Variant)**\\nThis advanced, reconstruction-free variant replaces the pixel-level objective with a perceptual reconstruction loss in the VLM\\'s feature space. This eliminates the need for the `g_sem` module.\\n*   **Training Objective:** The world model is trained to produce latent states `s_t` from which the decoder can generate an image `x̂_t` that is semantically similar to the original `x_t`, as judged by the VLM.\\n    `L_WM = L_dyn + β * L_semantic_recon`\\n    where the semantic reconstruction loss is:\\n    `L_semantic_recon = || sg(f_VLM(x_t)) - f_VLM(p_ϕ(x̂_t | s_t)) ||^2`\\n    Here, the VLM itself acts as the loss function, forcing the entire world model (encoder-decoder-dynamics) to operate in a semantically meaningful way.\\n\\n**Policy Learning:**\\nFor both SALVO variants, once the world model is trained, we follow the policy learning procedure from GenRL (Paper 1, Section 3.3). We train a *Latent Connector* and *Representation Aligner* to translate VLM prompts (visual or language) into target latent state trajectories. An actor-critic policy is then trained entirely in imagination to match these target trajectories, using the cosine distance reward and best-matching trajectory alignment from GenRL.\\n\\n**Proposed Experiment Outline:**\\n1.  **Datasets & Setup:** Use DMControl Suite (Walker, Cheetah, etc.) and Kitchen environments with vision-only, reward-free data as in GenRL. Pre-compute and store all VLM embeddings for the training dataset offline to manage computational cost.\\n\\n2.  **Models & Baselines:**\\n    *   **SALVO-Aux & SALVO-Recon (Proposed):** The two variants described above.\\n    *   **Baseline 1 (GenRL):** An exact reimplementation of GenRL, with a world model trained without any semantic guidance.\\n    *   **Baseline 2 (Dreamer + Oracle Rewards):** DreamerV3 (Paper 2) trained with ground-truth rewards to provide a performance ceiling on applicable tasks.\\n    *   *Fair Comparison:* For SALVO-Aux vs. GenRL, total model parameters will be kept comparable by adjusting decoder capacity to account for `g_sem`.\\n\\n3.  **Experimental Phases & Key Evaluations:**\\n    *   **Phase 1: World Model Training.** Train all world models (SALVO variants, GenRL baseline) on the offline dataset.\\n    *   **Phase 2: Connector/Aligner Training & Policy Learning.** For each trained world model, train the connector/aligner and then the final policy for a suite of in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks specified by prompts.\\n    *   **Phase 3: Rigorous Evaluation.**\\n        *   **Primary Metric:** Normalized episodic return on evaluation tasks.\\n        *   **Dynamics Fidelity Analysis:** To address the risk of sacrificing physics for semantics, we will plot the long-term rollout prediction error (in pixel-space) against the semantic weight `β`. We expect a trade-off, and finding a `β` that improves semantic control without catastrophically degrading dynamics is a key goal.\\n        *   **Semantic Richness Analysis (VQA on Reconstructions):** We will feed reconstructed images `x̂_t` from each model into a held-out VQA model (e.g., LLaVA) and ask probing questions (e.g., \"Is the agent\\'s leg straight?\", \"Is the agent moving quickly?\"). Higher VQA accuracy on SALVO\\'s reconstructions will serve as direct evidence for richer semantic content.\\n        *   **Zero-Shot Generalization Test:** Evaluate all methods on a set of zero-shot prompts describing novel styles or compositions of behaviors (e.g., \"walk backwards cautiously,\" \"hop like a rabbit\") that are semantically distinct from training data behaviors.\\n\\n4.  **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   Sweep the semantic loss weight `β` on a logarithmic scale and plot its effect on task return, dynamics loss, and semantic loss.\\n    *   Compare the predictive MSE loss `L_semantic` against a contrastive loss alternative.\\n    *   Evaluate the sensitivity of the approach to different pre-trained VLM backbones.\\n\\n**Concrete Example:**\\nTask prompt: \"A robot performing a *graceful* pirouette.\"\\n*   **Baseline (GenRL):** The world model, trained on pixel reconstruction, captures the physics of turning. Its latent states `s_t` represent this motion. The GenRL connector maps the prompt to a target trajectory `s_task_seq` in this space. The agent learns to turn, but the model may have discarded the subtle visual cues of \"gracefulness\" (smooth velocity profile, limb posture) as they are not crucial for basic reconstruction. The resulting motion may be a simple, jerky spin.\\n*   **SALVO (Proposed Method):** During its training, SALVO\\'s latents `s_t` were forced to be predictive of VLM embeddings. Videos of \"graceful\" motions in the dataset, having distinct VLM embeddings from clumsy ones, will have forced `s_t` to encode these distinguishing features. The world model itself now has an implicit understanding of \"grace\". The connector maps the prompt to a target trajectory grounded in these semantically-rich states. The policy, trained in this superior imagined reality, is more likely to discover the fine motor controls needed for a truly graceful pirouette, as its underlying world model understands the semantic target.\\n\\n**Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations**\\n*   **Risk 1 – Semantic Over-reliance & Loss of Physicality:** The semantic loss term (especially with large `β`) might overshadow the dynamics loss, leading to physically implausible or unstable rollouts.\\n    *   **Fallback:** The \"Dynamics Fidelity Analysis\" is our primary tool for diagnosing this. We will carefully tune `β` via a grid search, potentially using a curriculum that gradually increases its weight. We will monitor the dynamics loss component `L_dyn` during training and halt if it diverges.\\n\\n*   **Risk 2 – VLM Bias Propagation:** The world model could inherit spurious correlations or social biases from the frozen VLM.\\n    *   **Fallback:** This is an inherent risk of using foundation models. The `L_dyn` and (for SALVO-Aux) `L_recon` terms provide strong, independent learning signals grounded in the environment\\'s reality, which should mitigate VLM-only artifacts. In analysis, we could explore which layers of the VLM are most effective, potentially using less abstract layers to reduce complex biases.\\n\\n*   **Risk 3 – Increased Computational Cost:** The method adds computational steps involving the VLM.\\n    *   **Fallback:** For SALVO-Aux, we will pre-compute and cache VLM embeddings for the entire training dataset, making the added cost in the training loop minimal (just one pass through the small `g_sem` MLP). For SALVO-Recon, the cost is higher as it requires a VLM forward pass on each generated image in the batch; this is a known trade-off for reconstruction-free methods, justified by the potential for much higher quality representations.\\n\\n*   **Risk 4 – Difficulty of Semantic Prediction/Reconstruction:** Predicting high-dimensional VLM embeddings (SALVO-Aux) or optimizing through a VLM on noisy reconstructions (SALVO-Recon) could lead to noisy gradients and difficult training.\\n    *   **Fallback:** We can experiment with predicting a lower-dimensional projection of the VLM embeddings. The ablation study comparing MSE to a contrastive loss is also a direct mitigation, as contrastive objectives can be more stable. Using a more capable decoder architecture could improve reconstruction quality for SALVO-Recon.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': '**Dissecting the Feedback**\\n\\nI\\'m beginning to break down the feedback on the \\'SALVO\\' research idea.

However, the world model itself is trained on objectives like pixel reconstruction, which are agnostic to the rich semantic content that VLMs capture. There is no guarantee that the subtle visual details distinguishing \"a graceful walk\" from \"a normal walk\"—details a VLM is sensitive to—are preserved in the latent space.\n",

The GenRL connector maps the prompt to a target trajectory `s_task_seq` in this space. The agent learns to turn, but the model may have discarded the subtle visual cues of \"gracefulness\" (smooth velocity profile, limb posture) as they are not crucial for basic reconstruction. The resulting motion may be a simple, jerky spin.\n",
            "*   **SALVO (Proposed Method):** During its training, SALVO's latents `s_t` were forced to be predictive of VLM embeddings. Videos of \"graceful\" motions in the dataset, having distinct VLM embeddings from clumsy ones, will have forced `s_t` to encode these distinguishing features. The world model itself now has an implicit understanding of \"grace\". The connector maps the prompt to a target trajectory grounded in these semantically-rich states. The policy, trained in this superior imagined reality, is more likely to discover the fine motor controls needed for a truly graceful pirouette, as its underlying world model understands the semantic target.\n",

Try latent-only training with a perceptual‐reconstruction term ‖f_VLM(x)-f_VLM(x̂)‖.\"\\n    *   Evaluator 2 (E2): \"Limited novelty - essentially adds an auxiliary prediction head to existing world models.\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The original idea of adding an auxiliary loss (`L_semantic`) is viewed as incremental. I need to propose a more fundamental integration of VLM semantics into the world model\\'s learning process to significantly boost novelty.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will acknowledge the critique by framing the original idea as `SALVO-Aux`.\\n    2.  I will introduce a more novel and ambitious variant, `SALVO-P` (for Perceptual), directly based on E1\\'s suggestion. This method will **replace** the standard pixel-based reconstruction loss (`L_recon`) with a **perceptual reconstruction loss** in the VLM\\'s embedding space. The new loss will be `L_perceptual = || sg(f_VLM(x_t)) - f_VLM(p_ϕ(x̂_t | s_t)) ||^2`, where `f_VLM` is the VLM\\'s vision encoder and `p_ϕ(x̂_t | s_t)` is the world model\\'s decoder.\\n    3.  This change aligns the work with the trend of reconstruction-free world models (like DreamerPro) but uses a rich, pre-trained semantic space for supervision instead of learned prototypes. This makes the core contribution much more significant. In the revised idea, SALVO will refer to this new paradigm, with the auxiliary loss version presented as a simpler ablation.\\n\\n#### Section: Motivation and Theoretical Justification\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   E2: \"Lacks strong theoretical justification for why predicting VLM embeddings should improve downstream task performance.\"\\n    *   E2: \"The connection between better VLM embedding prediction and improved control performance is assumed rather than rigorously established.\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The motivation needs to be more compelling. While a full theoretical proof is out of scope for an empirical paper, the intuition must be stronger.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will strengthen the motivation by focusing on the concept of **\"irreversible semantic compression.\"** I\\'ll argue that standard pixel-reconstruction losses (like MSE) are blind to VLM-salient features (e.g., subtle textures, object states) that don\\'t greatly affect pixel-wise error but are crucial for understanding prompted tasks. A standard encoder, optimizing for pixel reconstruction, may discard this information irreversibly.\\n    2.  SALVO\\'s objective (in both variants) directly forces the latent state `s_t` to preserve this otherwise lost semantic information, creating a more \"semantically lossless\" compression. This provides a clearer causal link: better-preserved semantics lead to a more accurate world model from the perspective of a VLM-based reward function, enabling better policy learning.\\n\\n#### Section: Experimental Rigor and Evaluation\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   E1: \"Evaluation Rigor: What external metric demonstrates richer semantics? Ask a held-out VQA model questions about reconstructed frames.\"\\n    *   E1: \"Risk Mitigation: How will you know if β is too large? Plot dynamics-prediction error vs β; stop early if error spikes.\"\\n    *   E1: \"Will VLM-aligned latents still respect accurate physics? Compare rollout prediction error (pixels & proprioception) against Dreamer at β ∈ {0, 0.1, 1}.\"\\n    *   E1: \"Are improvements due to extra parameters? Keep parameter count fixed.\"\\n    *   E1: \"Does alignment help unseen VLM prompts? Evaluate on zero-shot prompts describing styles absent from training clips.\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The experimental plan needs more specific, rigorous evaluations to (1) prove that the latents are indeed semantically richer and (2) ensure this doesn\\'t come at the cost of physical accuracy. It also needs to control for confounding variables like parameter count.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  **New Semantic Metric (VQA):** I will add a new evaluation metric under \"Secondary Metrics\". We will feed reconstructed images from SALVO and the GenRL baseline into a held-out Visual Question Answering (VQA) model (e.g., LLaVA). Higher accuracy on questions about the reconstructed scenes from SALVO would provide strong, external evidence of superior semantic preservation.\\n    2.  **Dynamics Fidelity Analysis:** I will add a dedicated analysis to the experiment plan. We will plot the open-loop rollout prediction error (e.g., MSE between predicted and ground-truth future states) against the semantic loss weight (`β`). This directly addresses the risk of \"catastrophic interference\" and quantifies the trade-off between semantic richness and dynamic accuracy.\\n    3.  **Parameter Control:** I will add a note in the \"Models & Baselines\" section specifying that all compared models will have their total parameter counts matched (e.g., by adjusting decoder size) to ensure a fair comparison.\\n    4.  **Zero-Shot Generalization:** I will make the generalization test more concrete, specifying evaluation on prompts describing behaviors or styles (e.g., \"walk with a limp,\" \"jump hesitantly\") that are qualitatively different from the expert data.\\n\\n#### Section: Pitfalls, Mitigations, and Ablations\\n\\n*   **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    *   E1: \"Feasible: Pre-compute InternVideo2 embeddings once\"\\n    *   E2: \"Have you considered other forms of semantic alignment beyond MSE loss (e.g., contrastive learning)?\"\\n    *   E2: \"Have you considered curriculum learning approaches for gradually increasing the weight of semantic loss?\"\\n    *   E2: \"Computational overhead concerns are not adequately quantified or addressed\"\\n*   **Identify what needs to change:** The pitfalls and ablations section can be more detailed and proactive in addressing potential issues and exploring design choices.\\n*   **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  **Computational Cost:** I will update the \"Potential Pitfalls\" section to clearly distinguish the computational cost of the two SALVO variants. For the auxiliary loss version, VLM embeddings can be pre-computed. For the perceptual reconstruction version (`SALVO-P`), I will explicitly state that this requires an additional VLM forward pass *inside the training loop* and acknowledge this as a trade-off for its enhanced novelty and potential performance.\\n    2.  **Curriculum Learning:** I will add \"curriculum learning for `β`\" as a specific mitigation strategy for the risk of semantic over-reliance, building on E2\\'s suggestion.\\n    3.  **Alternative Loss Ablation:** I will add a new ablation study to compare the MSE-based semantic loss with a contrastive version, demonstrating a broader exploration of the design space.\\n    4.  **No Pertinent Feedback to Discard:** All the feedback provided by the evaluators is constructive and helpful for strengthening the research proposal. I will address all points.\\n\\nBy implementing these changes, the revised idea will be more novel (the perceptual reconstruction variant), better motivated (the irreversible compression argument), and supported by a much more rigorous and comprehensive experimental plan that preemptively addresses key scientific questions and risks.\\n\\n<REVISED IDEA>\\n\\n## Generated Research Idea\\n\\n**Title:** SALVO: Semantically-Augmented Latent Video-Observability in World Models\\n\\n**Observed Phenomenon**\\nGenerative world models like Dreamer learn powerful latent representations, but their training objectives (e.g., pixel-level reconstruction) are often agnostic to the rich semantic content that pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at capturing. This can lead to an \"irreversible semantic compression,\" where subtle but meaningful visual details (e.g., the difference between a confident stride and a hesitant shuffle) are discarded by the world model\\'s encoder because they are insignificant for pixel reconstruction, even though they are critical for interpreting complex VLM-provided prompts.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nCurrent methods, like GenRL, connect VLMs to world models *post-hoc*, learning a \"connector\" from a VLM\\'s representation to a pre-trained, semantically-agnostic world model latent space. This approach is limited by the semantic quality of the world model\\'s latents; if the necessary semantic information was already lost during the world model\\'s initial training, no connector can fully recover it.\\n\\n*   *Condition:* We don’t yet have world models whose latent representations are fundamentally regularized by the perceptual understanding of large VLMs *during* their foundational training, forcing them to preserve VLM-salient information.\\n*   *Consequence:* The world model forms an impoverished, semantically-shallow model of the environment. This hinders an agent\\'s ability to learn policies for nuanced tasks specified by VLM prompts, leading to poor generalization, misinterpretation of goals, and an inability to ground complex language in the world\\'s dynamics accurately.\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\n\"Dream to Control\" (Dreamer) established the power of learning behaviors in an imagined latent space, but its representations are optimized for reconstruction and dynamics, not semantics. \"GenRL\" brilliantly uses VLMs for task specification but treats the world model as a fixed black box, simply mapping VLM embeddings to its pre-existing latent space. The core limitation is that the world model\\'s latent atoms may not correspond to the VLM\\'s semantic atoms.\\n\\nSALVO is inspired by a simple question: what if we force the world model to see the world through the \"eyes\" of a VLM from the very beginning? Instead of merely augmenting a world model with an auxiliary semantic loss, we propose a more fundamental change: replacing the pixel-reconstruction loss entirely. We will use a powerful, pre-trained VLM (InternVideo2) as a perceptual loss function, tasking the world model not with recreating pixels, but with recreating the VLM\\'s *semantic embedding* of the visual scene.\\n\\nThis approach, SALVO, is hypothesized to work better because it ensures the world model\\'s latent space is inherently structured around high-level semantic concepts. This will produce a better-conditioned and more expressive latent space for imagination, leading to more accurate imagined rollouts for VLM-specified tasks and simplifying the subsequent learning of the aligner and connector modules from GenRL.\\n\\n**Hypothesis**\\nTraining a generative world model using a perceptual reconstruction loss defined in the embedding space of a pre-trained VLM—instead of a traditional pixel-space loss—will produce a world model that:\\n1.  Learns a more semantically meaningful and physically consistent latent representation of the environment.\\n2.  Enables an agent to achieve higher performance and sample efficiency on complex downstream tasks specified by VLM prompts.\\n3.  Demonstrates superior zero-shot generalization to novel tasks and stylistic variations compared to world models trained with pixel-reconstruction, even those augmented with post-hoc VLM-alignment.\\n\\n**Proposed Method:**\\nSALVO re-envisions the world model training objective by replacing pixel-level supervision with VLM-native perceptual supervision.\\n\\n1.  **Base World Model Architecture:** We adopt a generative world model architecture similar to Dreamer/GenRL, with an Encoder (`q_ϕ(s_t | x_t)`), a Sequence Model (`h_t = f_ϕ(...)`), a Dynamics Predictor (`p_ϕ(s_t | h_t)`), and a Decoder (`p_ϕ(x̂_t | s_t)`).\\n2.  **Foundation VLM as a Loss Function:** We use a fixed, pre-trained video-language model, `f_VLM` (e.g., InternVideo2), as a frozen perceptual encoder.\\n3.  **SALVO Perceptual Training Objective:** The world model\\'s parameters `ϕ` are trained to minimize a composite loss that replaces the standard reconstruction loss with a perceptual loss in the VLM embedding space:\\n    `L_SALVO = L_perceptual + L_dyn`\\n    where:\\n    *   **`L_perceptual = || sg(f_VLM(x_t)) - f_VLM(p_ϕ(x̂_t | s_t)) ||^2`**. This is the core novelty. It penalizes differences between the VLM\\'s embedding of the real observation `x_t` and the VLM\\'s embedding of the model\\'s reconstructed observation `x̂_t`. This forces the entire autoencoding pipeline to be \"VLM-aware\". The gradient flows through `f_VLM` and the decoder `p_ϕ` back to the latent `s_t` and the encoder `q_ϕ`.\\n    *   `L_dyn = D_KL[q_ϕ(s_t|x_t) || p_ϕ(s_t|h_t)]` is the standard dynamics learning loss from Dreamer/GenRL, ensuring temporal consistency in the latent space.\\n4.  **Task Specification and Policy Learning (from GenRL):** Once the SALVO world model is trained, we follow the robust procedure from GenRL for task execution:\\n    *   Train the **Representation Aligner** and **Latent Connector** to map VLM prompts (visual or language) to target latent state sequences `s_task_seq` in SALVO\\'s semantically rich latent space.\\n    *   Train an actor-critic policy `π_AC` purely in imagination using the reward function `r_SALVO = cos( projection(s_dyn), projection(s_task) )` and the \"best matching trajectory\" technique for temporal alignment.\\n\\n**Proposed Experiment Outline:**\\n\\n1.  **Datasets:** Use the DMControl Suite (Walker, Cheetah, Quadruped, Stickman) and Kitchen environments with the same vision-only, reward-free datasets as GenRL to ensure comparability.\\n2.  **Models & Baselines:**\\n    *   **SALVO (Proposed):** The full method using the `L_perceptual` objective.\\n    *   **Baseline 1 (GenRL):** A faithful implementation of GenRL, using a standard world model trained with pixel-reconstruction loss (`L_recon`) as described in their paper.\\n    *   **Baseline 2 (Parameter-Matched GenRL):** To control for parameter count, this baseline will have its decoder size reduced, and an MLP head added (matching the parameter count of `f_VLM`\\'s input layers) to ensure a fair comparison against the computational graph of SALVO.\\n    *   **Ablation 1 (SALVO-Aux):** Our original idea. A GenRL-style world model augmented with an *auxiliary* semantic prediction loss: `L = L_recon + L_dyn + β * L_semantic_pred`, where `L_semantic_pred` tasks the latent `s_t` with predicting `f_VLM(x_t)`. This tests if merely augmenting is sufficient, versus SALVO\\'s full replacement.\\n3.  **Experimental Phases & Evaluation:**\\n    *   **Phase 1: World Model Training:** Train all world model variants (SALVO, GenRL, SALVO-Aux). VLM embeddings for training data will be pre-computed to accelerate training where possible (e.g., for `L_semantic_pred` and the ground truth part of `L_perceptual`).\\n    *   **Phase 2: Connector/Policy Training & Evaluation:** For each model, train the aligner/connector and then the actor-critic policy for a suite of in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks specified by language/visual prompts.\\n4.  **Metrics & Success Criteria:**\\n    *   **Primary Success Metric:** SALVO must achieve significantly higher average episodic returns than GenRL and SALVO-Aux baselines, especially on semantically complex and OOD tasks.\\n    *   **Secondary Metrics:**\\n        *   **Sample Efficiency:** Time/steps for the policy to reach 80% of its final performance.\\n        *   **Zero-Shot Generalization:** Performance on prompts describing stylistic variations not present in the expert data (e.g., prompt: \"walk with a limp\" or \"prance like a pony\").\\n        *   **Semantic Richness (VQA Analysis):** Reconstruct held-out video sequences using each trained world model. Feed these reconstructions into a frozen, third-party VQA model (e.g., LLaVA) and ask questions about the scene (e.g., \"Is the agent on two feet?\", \"Is the cabinet door open?\"). Higher VQA accuracy on SALVO\\'s reconstructions is a direct measure of superior semantic preservation.\\n        *   **Dynamics Fidelity Analysis:** Plot the open-loop dynamics prediction error (MSE in latent space over 50 steps) against the semantic loss weight (`β` for SALVO-Aux) or implicitly against the `L_perceptual` objective. We must show that SALVO does not significantly harm dynamics prediction compared to GenRL.\\n5.  **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   Compare SALVO (perceptual loss) directly against SALVO-Aux (auxiliary loss).\\n    *   Ablate the loss function: Compare the L2 norm (`||...||^2`) for `L_perceptual` with a cosine distance-based loss.\\n    *   Ablate the VLM: Test with a different VLM family (e.g., SigLIP-based) to check for robustness.\\n\\n**Concrete Example:**\\nConsider the task \"stickman doing a headstand\" from a language prompt.\\n*   **Baseline (GenRL):** The world model, trained on pixel reconstruction, might learn to represent an inverted stickman. However, it may not differentiate between a wobbly, failing headstand and a stable one, as the pixel-level difference is small. The generated target trajectory might be ambiguous, leading to a policy that struggles to find and hold the stable pose.\\n*   **SALVO (Proposed Method):** The VLM `f_VLM` has likely seen many images of stable vs. unstable human poses and encodes \"stability\" as a key semantic feature. SALVO\\'s `L_perceptual` loss forces its decoder/encoder to be sensitive to these features. When the agent imagines, its internal model understands the visual correlates of \"stability.\" The target latent trajectory `s_task_seq` generated from the \"headstand\" prompt will thus correspond to a *stable* headstand, providing a much clearer learning signal and enabling the policy to learn the fine motor control required to achieve and maintain the pose.\\n\\n**Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations**\\n*   **Risk 1 – Dynamics Degradation:** The `L_perceptual` loss might prioritize semantic accuracy at the cost of physical plausibility, leading to inaccurate dynamics predictions.\\n    *   **Fallback:** The `L_dyn` term is designed to prevent this. Our \"Dynamics Fidelity Analysis\" will explicitly monitor this trade-off. If degradation is severe, we can introduce a small, heavily down-weighted pixel-reconstruction loss (`γ * L_recon`) as a regularizer.\\n*   **Risk 2 – VLM Bias:** The world model will inherit any biases present in the frozen `f_VLM`.\\n    *   **Fallback:** This is an inherent risk of leveraging foundation models. We will acknowledge this limitation and can test robustness by swapping VLMs in an ablation. The `L_dyn` component provides an independent, physics-based learning signal that should mitigate the VLM\\'s influence on pure dynamics.\\n*   **Risk 3 – Computational Cost:** The `L_perceptual` objective requires a VLM forward pass on every reconstructed image *within* the training loop, which is computationally expensive compared to a simple decoder.\\n    *   **Fallback:** This is a direct trade-off for higher performance and novelty. We will precisely quantify this overhead. We can mitigate it by using a smaller, distilled version of the VLM or by freezing parts of the world model\\'s decoder to reduce the backward pass cost.\\n*   **Risk 4 – Training Instability:** Backpropagating through a large, frozen VLM might introduce noisy or large gradients, destabilizing training.\\n    *   **Fallback:** We will employ gradient clipping and experiment with lower learning rates. We can also explore stopping the gradient at an earlier layer of the VLM, trading off semantic richness for stability. A curriculum that slowly unfreezes layers of the VLM during backprop could also be explored.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': \"**Analyzing Feedback Iteratively**\\n\\nI'm currently dissecting the provided feedback, treating each point as a potential pivot for the research. I plan to categorize the critiques, pinpointing the core weaknesses.

The goal is to refine the methodology and improve the experimental design.\\n\\n\\n**Prioritizing Critical Points**\\n\\nI'm now working through the individual feedback from Evaluator 1, meticulously extracting the core concerns. The most pressing issues appear to be around novelty, potential for instability, and the overall evaluation strategy.

I am now seriously considering a variant of my proposed method which *replaces* the traditional pixel reconstruction loss with a loss calculated in the VLM embedding space. This will move beyond augmenting and toward a potentially novel, reconstruction-free approach, aligning with recent advances. The goal is to make the model more efficient and semantically informed. I plan to incorporate this as a core experimental element, to be tested against the current framework.\\n\\n\\n**Revising Experimental Design**\\n\\nI'm currently wrestling with the implications of Evaluator 1's feedback on novelty and experimental design. A key change involves replacing pixel reconstruction with a semantic loss in the VLM space, significantly boosting novelty, as suggested. I'll rigorously test this reconstruction-free variant against the original approach and current baselines. Furthermore, I'll address computation concerns through pre-computation.\\n\\n\\n**Revising and Refining Plans**\\n\\nI'm presently re-evaluating the proposed methodology, integrating insights from both reviewers. The major adjustment will be to explore a more novel approach: *replacing* the pixel-based reconstruction loss with a VLM-based semantic loss. This aims to boost both novelty and efficiency. I am now planning to add an ablation or a second experimental variant. Additionally, I'm addressing computational concerns by pre-computing VLM embeddings.\\n\\n\\n**Implementing Evaluator Feedback**\\n\\nI'm now organizing and integrating the feedback from Evaluator 1. I plan to directly address the concern regarding novelty by introducing an ablation where I replace the original pixel-based reconstruction loss with a semantic loss in the VLM embedding space. I will also include VQA evaluation, alongside implementing pre-computation to mitigate computational costs, and add a parameter check. These modifications aim to bolster the methodology and refine the experimental plan.\\n\\n\\n**Revising the Experimental Plan**\\n\\nI've finalized the integration of Evaluator 1's detailed feedback. The main actions are: 1) replacing the pixel reconstruction loss with a VLM-based semantic loss for enhanced novelty, as suggested; 2) introducing VQA evaluation and addressing computational constraints through pre-computation, as requested; and 3) adding a check on parameter counts. These improvements are critical for the study's validity.\\n\\n\\n**Refining Experimental Plans**\\n\\nI'm now consolidating feedback from both evaluators, particularly the emphasis on enhancing novelty and addressing computational costs. I plan to introduce an ablation experiment, replacing the traditional pixel-based reconstruction loss with a semantic loss in the VLM embedding space. This reconstruction-free method, is expected to boost both novelty and semantic fidelity. I am also addressing computational concerns with pre-computation. Furthermore, I intend to incorporate VQA to validate richer semantics.\\n\\n\\n**Consolidating and Refining**\\n\\nI'm currently organizing the feedback from both evaluators, focusing on areas for improvement. I'm preparing to introduce a novel approach: Replacing the pixel reconstruction loss with a VLM embedding semantic loss. This is complemented by the VQA evaluation to validate richer semantics, and pre-computing embeddings to reduce computation costs. I am also adding a parameter check, as suggested.\\n\\n\\n**Implementing Changes and Plans**\\n\\nI'm now translating the feedback-driven revisions into a concrete experimental plan. This includes detailing the new VLM-based semantic loss, specifying a parameter-matched baseline for comparison, and incorporating both a VQA metric and a dynamics-prediction error analysis. The aim is to deliver a more novel, efficient, and robust evaluation strategy.\\n\\n\\n**Implementing Feedback and Changes**\\n\\nI'm now hard at work translating the planned revisions into the experimental plan. I'm creating a baseline with equivalent parameter counts, and specifying both the new semantic VQA metric and the planned dynamics-prediction error analysis. I'm also finalizing the ablation experiments:  comparing `SALVO-Aux` to `SALVO-Recon`, and including the logarithmic sweep for the parameter, with additional comparisons using a contrastive objective and zero-shot prompt evaluation. The key is to make the evaluation robust.\\n\\n\\n**Integrating Refined Insights**\\n\\nI'm now in the process of weaving together the extensive feedback, meticulously integrating it into a revised experimental plan. My focus is now on replacing the pixel reconstruction, as suggested, with VLM embedding reconstruction. I am expanding the experimental plan to include not only this, but also a robust VQA-based semantic validation and a dynamics-prediction error analysis to address potential issues with dynamics.

            "SALVO is inspired by a simple question: what if we force the world model to see the world through the \"eyes\" of a VLM from the very beginning? Instead of merely augmenting a world model with an auxiliary semantic loss, we propose a more fundamental change: replacing the pixel-reconstruction loss entirely. We will use a powerful, pre-trained VLM (InternVideo2) as a perceptual loss function, tasking the world model not with recreating pixels, but with recreating the VLM's *semantic embedding* of the visual scene.\n",

            "        *   **Semantic Richness (VQA Analysis):** Reconstruct held-out video sequences using each trained world model. Feed these reconstructions into a frozen, third-party VQA model (e.g., LLaVA) and ask questions about the scene (e.g., \"Is the agent on two feet?\", \"Is the cabinet door open?\"). Higher VQA accuracy on SALVO's reconstructions is a direct measure of superior semantic preservation.\n",
            "        *   **Dynamics Fidelity Analysis:** Plot the open-loop dynamics prediction error (MSE in latent space over 50 steps) against the semantic loss weight (`β` for SALVO-Aux) or implicitly against the `L_perceptual` objective.

However, it may not differentiate between a wobbly, failing headstand and a stable one, as the pixel-level difference is small. The generated target trajectory might be ambiguous, leading to a policy that struggles to find and hold the stable pose.\n",
            "*   **SALVO (Proposed Method):** The VLM `f_VLM` has likely seen many images of stable vs. unstable human poses and encodes \"stability\" as a key semantic feature. SALVO's `L_perceptual` loss forces its decoder/encoder to be sensitive to these features. When the agent imagines, its internal model understands the visual correlates of \"stability.\" The target latent trajectory `s_task_seq` generated from the \"headstand\" prompt will thus correspond to a *stable* headstand, providing a much clearer learning signal and enabling the policy to learn the fine motor control required to achieve and maintain the pose.\n",

The `L_dyn` component provides an independent, physics-based learning signal that should mitigate the VLM's influence on pure dynamics.\n",
            "*   **Risk 3 – Computational Cost:** The `L_perceptual` objective requires a VLM forward pass on every reconstructed image *within* the training loop, which is computationally expensive compared to a simple decoder.\n",

Try latent-only training with a perceptual‐reconstruction term ‖f_VLM(x)-f_VLM(x̂)‖.\"\\n    - Evaluator 2: \"Limited novelty - essentially adds an auxiliary prediction head to existing world models\"\\n\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The original idea of adding an *auxiliary* semantic loss (`L_semantic`) is incremental. The feedback correctly points out that a more innovative and impactful approach would be to *replace* the traditional pixel-based reconstruction loss (`L_recon`) entirely with a loss defined in the VLM\\'s perceptual space. This fundamentally changes the world model\\'s training objective from visual mimicry to semantic mimicry.\\n\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    - I will pivot the core of the **Proposed Method**. The primary proposed method, now called SALVO, will no longer use pixel-reconstruction. Instead, its encoder-decoder system will be trained to minimize a **perceptual reconstruction loss**.\\n    - The new loss will be `L_perceptual = || sg(f_VLM(x_t)) - f_VLM(p_ϕ(x̂_t | s_t)) ||^2`, as suggested. Here, the world model decodes a latent state `s_t` into a reconstructed image `x̂_t`, which is then passed through the *same frozen VLM* to get a reconstructed embedding. The loss is the distance between the original and reconstructed VLM embeddings.\\n    - The original idea of an auxiliary prediction head will be demoted to a baseline/ablation study, termed \"SALVO-Aux\", to demonstrate that this deeper integration (replacing the loss) is superior.\\n    - The **Motivation** and **Hypothesis** sections will be rewritten to focus on this new, more novel approach, centering on the argument of \"irreversible semantic compression\" where pixel-level losses are a poor proxy for the semantic features that VLMs use for task understanding.\\n\\n### Section 2: Theoretical Justification and Rigor\\n\\n- **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    - Evaluator 2: \"Lacks strong theoretical justification for why predicting VLM embeddings should improve downstream task performance\"\\n    - Evaluator 2: \"The connection between better VLM embedding prediction and improved control performance is assumed rather than rigorously established\"\\n\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The original proposal didn\\'t sufficiently explain *why* aligning with VLM embeddings is beneficial beyond intuition. I need to provide a stronger causal argument and design experiments that explicitly test this connection.\\n\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    - I will enhance the **Motivation** section by elaborating on the concept of \"irreversible semantic compression.\" The argument is that standard reconstruction losses (like MSE on pixels) are forced to spend model capacity on high-frequency details that are often irrelevant to the semantic content a VLM cares about (e.g., precise grass texture vs. the presence of a path). By optimizing directly in the VLM\\'s embedding space, SALVO\\'s training objective is better aligned with the eventual goal of satisfying a VLM-specified prompt.\\n    - To empirically establish the connection, the **Proposed Experiment Outline** will include a new \"Semantic Richness\" evaluation metric suggested by Evaluator 1:\\n        - **VQA on Reconstructions:** Reconstructed frames `x̂_t` from both SALVO and baselines will be fed to a held-out Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. We will ask probing questions about semantically salient features (e.g., \"Is the agent on two feet?\", \"What object is the agent near?\"). Higher VQA accuracy for SALVO\\'s reconstructions would provide concrete evidence that its latent space preserves more task-relevant semantic information.\\n\\n### Section 3: Experimental Design, Baselines, and Ablations\\n\\n- **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    - Evaluator 1: \"To stand out you must prove a clear win over these alignment-only baselines\"\\n    - Evaluator 1: \"Are improvements due to extra parameters? Keep parameter count fixed\"\\n    - Evaluator 2: \"Missing important baselines (e.g., other auxiliary losses, different semantic targets)\"\\n    - Evaluator 2: \"Have you considered other forms of semantic alignment beyond MSE loss (e.g., contrastive learning...)?\\n    - Evaluator 1: \"Evaluate on zero-shot prompts describing styles absent from training clips.\"\\n\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The experimental plan needs to be more robust, with fairer baselines, more insightful ablations, and a stronger test for generalization.\\n\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    - **Baselines:** The `Proposed Experiment Outline` will feature a stronger set of baselines:\\n        1.  **GenRL (Paper 1):** The state-of-the-art post-hoc alignment method.\\n        2.  **Parameter-Matched GenRL:** To ensure a fair comparison, this baseline will have its world model\\'s decoder capacity increased to match the total parameter count of the SALVO model, thus controlling for performance gains from simply having more parameters.\\n        3.  **SALVO-Aux:** The original proposal (augmenting `L_recon` with an auxiliary semantic prediction loss) will be used as a baseline to demonstrate the superiority of fully replacing the reconstruction loss.\\n    - **Ablations:**\\n        1.  **Contrastive Alignment:** I will add a crucial ablation study comparing the proposed perceptual MSE loss to a **contrastive loss**. In this setup, we would project the latent state `s_t` into the VLM embedding space and use a contrastive objective (e.g. InfoNCE) where the embedding of the true observation `f_VLM(x_t)` is the positive sample, and embeddings from other states in the batch are the negatives. This directly addresses the reviewer\\'s suggestion.\\n        2.  **Zero-Shot Generalization:** I will add a specific evaluation phase focused on generalization to unseen prompts that describe novel styles or compositions of learned skills (e.g., \"walk with a limp,\" \"run backwards then jump\").

I will briefly mention it in the conclusion/future work section as an exciting research direction unlocked by having semantically rich latent spaces.\\n\\n<REVISED IDEA>\\n\\n## Generated Research Idea\\n\\n**Title:** SALVO: Training World Models in VLM Perceptual Space for Semantically-Grounded Control\\n\\n**Observed Phenomenon**\\nGenerative world models learn by compressing high-dimensional observations into a low-dimensional latent space, typically using a pixel-level reconstruction loss as a primary learning signal. However, this objective forces the model to expend capacity on high-frequency visual details that are often irrelevant for semantic understanding. This \"irreversible semantic compression\" means that subtle but task-critical visual cues (e.g., the difference between a \"limp\" and a \"stroll\") that are easily distinguishable by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) can be lost in the world model\\'s latent representation.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nCurrent world models, trained to be good at reconstructing pixels, are not explicitly optimized to preserve the semantic information that modern VLMs use to interpret the world. This creates a semantic gap between the world model\\'s understanding of the environment and the VLM\\'s interpretation of a task prompt.\\n\\n*   *Condition:* We don’t yet have world models whose representation learning is fundamentally guided by a rich, pre-trained perceptual metric, rather than a pixel-based one. The world model\\'s learning objective is misaligned with the semantic nature of VLM-provided goals.\\n*   *Consequence:* This misalignment leads to an impoverished imaginative faculty. The agent\\'s imagined trajectories may lack the necessary semantic detail to accurately plan for complex, language-defined tasks. This results in policies that fail to capture the nuances of the instructions, leading to poor generalization and suboptimal performance on tasks requiring fine-grained visual understanding.\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\nState-of-the-art methods like \"Dream to Control\" (Dreamer) build powerful world models based on reconstruction and dynamics prediction, but their representations are semantically agnostic. \"GenRL\" brilliantly addresses task specification by connecting a pre-trained VLM to a world model post-hoc via a \"latent connector\". However, this connector must bridge the gap between the VLM\\'s rich semantic space and the world model\\'s potentially semantically-sparse latent space.\\n\\nSALVO is motivated by a simple but profound question: What if the world model\\'s learning objective was not to fool the eye, but to fool a VLM? We propose to replace the conventional pixel-level reconstruction loss entirely with a **perceptual reconstruction loss** defined within the embedding space of a frozen, pre-trained VLM. Instead of forcing the model\\'s latents `s_t` to reconstruct the raw observation `x_t`, we train them to reconstruct the VLM\\'s *perception* of `x_t`.\\n\\nThis approach is hypothesized to be superior because it directly aligns the world model\\'s optimization with the semantic concepts embedded in the VLM. It encourages the latent space to be inherently structured around VLM-salient features, thereby learning a more semantically meaningful model of the world\\'s dynamics. This should not only lead to more accurate and nuanced imagined rollouts for VLM-specified tasks but also simplify the subsequent learning of the GenRL-style latent connector.\\n\\n**Hypothesis**\\nTraining a generative world model by replacing the pixel-reconstruction loss with a perceptual loss in a VLM\\'s embedding space will create a world model that:\\n1.  Produces reconstructions that are semantically richer, as measured by a held-out Visual Question Answering (VQA) model.\\n2.  Maintains sufficient physical fidelity for accurate dynamics prediction in imagination.\\n3.  Enables an agent to achieve higher task performance and demonstrate superior zero-shot generalization to novel, language-specified stylistic variations compared to models trained with pixel-reconstruction or with semantics as only an auxiliary objective.\\n\\n**Proposed Method:**\\nSALVO re-purposes the generative world model architecture (from Dreamer/GenRL) for semantic, rather than visual, fidelity.\\n\\n1.  **Base World Model Architecture:** We use a standard architecture with an encoder (`q_ϕ(s_t | x_t)`), a sequence model (e.g., GRU), a dynamics predictor (`p_ϕ(s_t | h_t)`), and a decoder (`p_ϕ(x̂_t | s_t)`).\\n2.  **Frozen Foundation VLM:** A pre-trained VLM (e.g., InternVideo2) `f_VLM` provides a fixed, rich perceptual mapping from images to embeddings.\\n3.  **Perceptual Reconstruction Loss:** The core of SALVO. We discard the traditional pixel-space `L_recon`. The new objective for the encoder/decoder (`ϕ`) is to minimize the distance between the VLM embedding of the original image and the VLM embedding of the reconstructed image:\\n    `L_perceptual = || sg(f_VLM(x_t)) - f_VLM(p_ϕ(x̂_t | s_t)) ||^2`\\n    The gradient from this loss flows back through `f_VLM`, the decoder `p_ϕ`, and the encoder `q_ϕ`, forcing the entire system to operate in a way that respects the VM\\'s perceptual space.\\n4.  **Combined World Model Training Objective:** The world model is trained to jointly predict dynamics in latent space and reconstruct in perceptual space.\\n    `L_SALVO = λ_dyn * L_dyn + λ_perc * L_perceptual`\\n    where `L_dyn = D_KL[q_ϕ(s_t|x_t) || p_ϕ(s_t|h_t)]` is the standard dynamics consistency loss from Dreamer/GenRL, and `λ` are balancing weights.\\n5.  **Curriculum Learning:** To prevent the perceptual loss from overwhelming the learning of stable dynamics initially, we propose a curriculum schedule. Training starts with `λ_dyn` high and `λ_perc` low, gradually shifting the emphasis to perceptual reconstruction as the dynamics model stabilizes.\\n6.  **Task Specification and Policy Learning:** Following the training of the SALVO world model, we adopt the policy learning framework from GenRL (Section 3.3). A latent Connector and Aligner are trained to map language/visual prompts to target latent state sequences `s_task_seq` in SALVO\\'s now-semantic latent space. An actor-critic policy is then trained in imagination to match these target trajectories, using the cosine-distance reward from GenRL (Eq. 3).\\n\\n**Proposed Experiment Outline:**\\n\\n1.  **Datasets & Environments:** DMControl Suite (Walker, Cheetah, Quadruped, Stickman) and Kitchen, using vision-only, reward-free datasets as in GenRL.\\n2.  **Models & Baselines:**\\n    *   **SALVO (Proposed):** World model trained with `L_SALVO` (dynamics + perceptual loss).\\n    *   **Baseline 1 (GenRL):** The method from Paper 1, using `L_recon + L_dyn`.\\n    *   **Baseline 2 (Parameter-Matched GenRL):** GenRL with an oversized decoder, matching the total parameter count of SALVO\\'s decoder + VLM\\'s encoder (for the forward pass on `x̂_t`). This controls for performance gains due to model size.\\n    *   **Baseline 3 (SALVO-Aux):** Our original idea. A world model trained with `L_recon + L_dyn + β*L_semantic_aux`, where `L_semantic_aux` is an auxiliary loss from a small MLP predicting `f_VLM(x_t)` from `s_t`. This tests if *augmenting* is as good as *replacing*.\\n3.  **Experimental Phases:**\\n    *   **Phase 1 (WM Training):** Train all world models (SALVO and baselines) on the offline dataset. Pre-compute and store VLM embeddings `f_VLM(x_t)` for all training data to manage computational cost.\\n    *   **Phase 2 (Connector/Policy Training):** For each trained world model, train a task-prompt connector and an actor-critic policy in imagination for a suite of in-distribution tasks (e.g., \"run fast,\" \"stand on one foot\").\\n4.  **Primary & Secondary Metrics:**\\n    *   **Primary Metric:** Average episodic return on a set of held-out in-distribution and out-of-distribution language/visual prompts.\\n    *   **Secondary Metrics:**\\n        *   **Zero-Shot Generalization:** Evaluate all models on a curated set of novel prompts describing stylistic variations not present in the training data (e.g., \"walk with a limp,\" \"prance like a pony,\" \"perform a hesitant pirouette\").\\n        *   **Semantic Richness (VQA Analysis):** Generate reconstructions `x̂_t` from all models. Feed these reconstructions into a frozen, third-party VQA model (e.g., LLaVA) and ask questions about the scene (e.g., \"Is the agent balanced?\", \"Are the agent\\'s arms raised?\"). Report VQA accuracy.\\n        *   **Dynamics Fidelity Analysis:** For SALVO, plot the open-loop dynamics prediction error (MSE in latent space over 50 steps) against the perceptual loss weight `λ_perc` to visualize the trade-off with physical accuracy.\\n5.  **Ablation Studies:**\\n    *   **Loss Function Form:** Compare the MSE-based `L_perceptual` with a cosine distance alternative.\\n    *   **Contrastive Alignment:** As a more advanced ablation, implement a contrastive version of SALVO-Aux. An MLP projects `s_t` into the VLM space, and a contrastive loss (InfoNCE) is used to pull this projection toward the true `f_VLM(x_t)` (positive) and push it away from embeddings of other states in the batch (negatives).\\n    *   **Curriculum Learning:** Compare performance with and without the curriculum for `λ` weights.\\n\\n**Concrete Example:**\\nConsider the language prompt \"robot performing a graceful pirouette.\"\\n*   **Baseline (GenRL):** The world model, optimized for pixel reconstruction, learns to represent \"turning.\" Its gradient is driven by minimizing pixel differences. It has no intrinsic concept of \"grace.\" The latent connector maps the VLM\\'s embedding for \"graceful pirouette\" to the closest available \"turning\" trajectory in this semantically-crude latent space. The resulting policy might turn, but likely in a mechanically efficient, not graceful, way.\\n*   **SALVO (Proposed Method):** SALVO\\'s world model is optimized via `L_perceptual`. Its learning gradient is directly shaped by the VLM\\'s assessment. If the VLM distinguishes between clumsy and graceful turns in its embedding space, SALVO\\'s decoder is explicitly forced to generate reconstructions that capture this distinction. The latent states `s_t` therefore must encode the necessary physical information (limb extension, smooth velocity curves) to produce a \"graceful-looking\" reconstruction. When the policy is trained in this world, it learns to control these semantically-meaningful latents, resulting in a motion that is far more likely to match the V-L\\'s nuanced understanding of \"graceful.\"\\n\\n**Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations**\\n*   **Risk 1 – Semantic Dominance vs. Physical Accuracy:** The perceptual loss might be prioritized at the expense of physically plausible dynamics, leading to \"pretty but impossible\" imagined rollouts.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** The `L_dyn` term, inherited from Dreamer (Paper 2), acts as a strong regularizer, anchoring the model to real-world transitions. The curriculum learning approach for `λ` weights is designed to establish stable dynamics first. The \"Dynamics Fidelity Analysis\" will quantify this trade-off.\\n*   **Risk 2 – VLM Inductive Biases:** The world model will inherit any biases, blind spots, or artifacts present in the frozen VLM.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** This is an inherent risk of using foundation models. The `L_dyn` term again provides a crucial grounding in reality. While out-of-scope for this project, future work could mitigate this by using an ensemble of diverse VLMs for the perceptual loss.\\n*   **Risk 3 – Computational Cost:** The forward pass through a large VLM `f_VLM(p_ϕ(x̂_t | s_t))` inside the training loop adds overhead.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** We will pre-compute and store the target VLM embeddings `f_VLM(x_t)` for the entire dataset offline. The per-step overhead is then one VLM forward pass on the reconstructed image, which is significant but manageable on modern hardware. We will quantify this overhead in our experiments.\\n*   **Risk 4 – Training Instability:** Replacing a well-understood loss like pixel-MSE with a complex, high-dimensional perceptual loss could lead to unstable training.\\n    *   **Mitigation:** We will carefully monitor gradients. The curriculum learning approach is the primary mitigation. We will also experiment with simpler loss formulations (cosine distance vs. MSE) and potentially use gradient clipping on `L_perceptual`.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': '**Reviewing Evaluator Feedback**\\n\\nI\\'m now breaking down the feedback from both evaluators.

I will plot the open-loop dynamics prediction error (e.g., latent-space MSE over long horizons, as in Dreamer) against the weight of the perceptual loss (`1-β` if the total loss is `β*L_dyn + (1-β)*L_perceptual`). This directly visualizes the impact on physics, as suggested.\n",

This should mitigate catastrophic interference.\n",

            "\n",
            "**Observed Phenomenon**\n",
            "Generative world models learn by compressing high-dimensional observations into a low-dimensional latent space, typically using a pixel-level reconstruction loss as a primary learning signal. However, this objective forces the model to expend capacity on high-frequency visual details that are often irrelevant for semantic understanding. This \"irreversible semantic compression\" means that subtle but task-critical visual cues (e.g., the difference between a \"limp\" and a \"stroll\") that are easily distinguishable by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) can be lost in the world model's latent representation.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Problem Statement:**\n",
            "Current world models, trained to be good at reconstructing pixels, are not explicitly optimized to preserve the semantic information that modern VLMs use to interpret the world. This creates a semantic gap between the world model's understanding of the environment and the VLM's interpretation of a task prompt.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   *Condition:* We don’t yet have world models whose representation learning is fundamentally guided by a rich, pre-trained perceptual metric, rather than a pixel-based one. The world model's learning objective is misaligned with the semantic nature of VLM-provided goals.\n",
            "*   *Consequence:* This misalignment leads to an impoverished imaginative faculty. The agent's imagined trajectories may lack the necessary semantic detail to accurately plan for complex, language-defined tasks. This results in policies that fail to capture the nuances of the instructions, leading to poor generalization and suboptimal performance on tasks requiring fine-grained visual understanding.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Motivation:**\n",
            "State-of-the-art methods like \"Dream to Control\" (Dreamer) build powerful world models based on reconstruction and dynamics prediction, but their representations are semantically agnostic. \"GenRL\" brilliantly addresses task specification by connecting a pre-trained VLM to a world model post-hoc via a \"latent connector\". However, this connector must bridge the gap between the VLM's rich semantic space and the world model's potentially semantically-sparse latent space.\n",
            "\n",
            "SALVO is motivated by a simple but profound question: What if the world model's learning objective was not to fool the eye, but to fool a VLM? We propose to replace the conventional pixel-level reconstruction loss entirely with a **perceptual reconstruction loss** defined within the embedding space of a frozen, pre-trained VLM. Instead of forcing the model's latents `s_t` to reconstruct the raw observation `x_t`, we train them to reconstruct the VLM's *perception* of `x_t`.\n",
            "\n",
            "This approach is hypothesized to be superior because it directly aligns the world model's optimization with the semantic concepts embedded in the VLM. It encourages the latent space to be inherently structured around VLM-salient features, thereby learning a more semantically meaningful model of the world's dynamics. This should not only lead to more accurate and nuanced imagined rollouts for VLM-specified tasks but also simplify the subsequent learning of the GenRL-style latent connector.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Hypothesis**\n",
            "Training a generative world model by replacing the pixel-reconstruction loss with a perceptual loss in a VLM's embedding space will create a world model that:\n",
            "1.  Produces reconstructions that are semantically richer, as measured by a held-out Visual Question Answering (VQA) model.\n",
            "2.  Maintains sufficient physical fidelity for accurate dynamics prediction in imagination.\n",
            "3.  Enables an agent to achieve higher task performance and demonstrate superior zero-shot generalization to novel, language-specified stylistic variations compared to models trained with pixel-reconstruction or with semantics as only an auxiliary objective.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Proposed Method:**\n",
            "SALVO re-purposes the generative world model architecture (from Dreamer/GenRL) for semantic, rather than visual, fidelity.\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Base World Model Architecture:** We use a standard architecture with an encoder (`q_ϕ(s_t | x_t)`), a sequence model (e.g., GRU), a dynamics predictor (`p_ϕ(s_t | h_t)`), and a decoder (`p_ϕ(x̂_t | s_t)`).\n",
            "2.  **Frozen Foundation VLM:** A pre-trained VLM (e.g., InternVideo2) `f_VLM` provides a fixed, rich perceptual mapping from images to embeddings.\n",
            "3.  **Perceptual Reconstruction Loss:** The core of SALVO. We discard the traditional pixel-space `L_recon`. The new objective for the encoder/decoder (`ϕ`) is to minimize the distance between the VLM embedding of the original image and the VLM embedding of the reconstructed image:\n",
            "    `L_perceptual = || sg(f_VLM(x_t)) - f_VLM(p_ϕ(x̂_t | s_t)) ||^2`\n",
            "    The gradient from this loss flows back through `f_VLM`, the decoder `p_ϕ`, and the encoder `q_ϕ`, forcing the entire system to operate in a way that respects the VM's perceptual space.\n",
            "4.  **Combined World Model Training Objective:** The world model is trained to jointly predict dynamics in latent space and reconstruct in perceptual space.\n",
            "    `L_SALVO = λ_dyn * L_dyn + λ_perc * L_perceptual`\n",
            "    where `L_dyn = D_KL[q_ϕ(s_t|x_t) || p_ϕ(s_t|h_t)]` is the standard dynamics consistency loss from Dreamer/GenRL, and `λ` are balancing weights.\n",
            "5.  **Curriculum Learning:** To prevent the perceptual loss from overwhelming the learning of stable dynamics initially, we propose a curriculum schedule. Training starts with `λ_dyn` high and `λ_perc` low, gradually shifting the emphasis to perceptual reconstruction as the dynamics model stabilizes.\n",
            "6.  **Task Specification and Policy Learning:** Following the training of the SALVO world model, we adopt the policy learning framework from GenRL (Section 3.3). A latent Connector and Aligner are trained to map language/visual prompts to target latent state sequences `s_task_seq` in SALVO's now-semantic latent space. An actor-critic policy is then trained in imagination to match these target trajectories, using the cosine-distance reward from GenRL (Eq. 3).\n",

            "        *   **Semantic Richness (VQA Analysis):** Generate reconstructions `x̂_t` from all models. Feed these reconstructions into a frozen, third-party VQA model (e.g., LLaVA) and ask questions about the scene (e.g., \"Is the agent balanced?\", \"Are the agent's arms raised?\"). Report VQA accuracy.\n",
            "        *   **Dynamics Fidelity Analysis:** For SALVO, plot the open-loop dynamics prediction error (MSE in latent space over 50 steps) against the perceptual loss weight `λ_perc` to visualize the trade-off with physical accuracy.\n",

            "    *   **Loss Function Form:** Compare the MSE-based `L_perceptual` with a cosine distance alternative.\n",
            "    *   **Contrastive Alignment:** As a more advanced ablation, implement a contrastive version of SALVO-Aux. An MLP projects `s_t` into the VLM space, and a contrastive loss (InfoNCE) is used to pull this projection toward the true `f_VLM(x_t)` (positive) and push it away from embeddings of other states in the batch (negatives).\n",
            "    *   **Curriculum Learning:** Compare performance with and without the curriculum for `λ` weights.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Concrete Example:**\n",
            "Consider the language prompt \"robot performing a graceful pirouette.\"\n",
            "*   **Baseline (GenRL):** The world model, optimized for pixel reconstruction, learns to represent \"turning.\" Its gradient is driven by minimizing pixel differences. It has no intrinsic concept of \"grace.\" The latent connector maps the VLM's embedding for \"graceful pirouette\" to the closest available \"turning\" trajectory in this semantically-crude latent space. The resulting policy might turn, but likely in a mechanically efficient, not graceful, way.\n",
            "*   **SALVO (Proposed Method):** SALVO's world model is optimized via `L_perceptual`. Its learning gradient is directly shaped by the VLM's assessment. If the VLM distinguishes between clumsy and graceful turns in its embedding space, SALVO's decoder is explicitly forced to generate reconstructions that capture this distinction. The latent states `s_t` therefore must encode the necessary physical information (limb extension, smooth velocity curves) to produce a \"graceful-looking\" reconstruction. When the policy is trained in this world, it learns to control these semantically-meaningful latents, resulting in a motion that is far more likely to match the V-L's nuanced understanding of \"graceful.\"\n",

            "    *   **Mitigation:** The `L_dyn` term, inherited from Dreamer (Paper 2), acts as a strong regularizer, anchoring the model to real-world transitions.

            "Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) methods that use online planning, such as Differentiable Tree Search (DTS), achieve strong performance by jointly optimizing a world model and a search algorithm. However, DTS and similar methods are designed for deterministic worlds. When deployed in non-deterministic environments, their deterministic world models fail to capture environmental stochasticity, leading them to learn an \"average\" world dynamic. This can result in sub-optimal or unsafe policies, as the planner is blind to low-probability, high-impact events.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Problem Statement:**\n",
            "State-of-the-art differentiable search methods in MBRL are constrained by their reliance on deterministic world models, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that are inherently stochastic. While methods exist for learning stochastic world models (e.g., STORM), they are typically trained separately from the planner, which prevents the planner and model from co-adapting. This separation means the world model is not optimized for the specific states and transitions that are most critical for the planner's decision-making process.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   *Condition:* We lack a framework that can jointly optimize a powerful, *stochastic* world model (capable of representing a distribution over next states) with a *differentiable tree search* algorithm in an end-to-end fashion.\n",
            "*   *Consequence:* The benefits of differentiable planning—learning a world model that is specifically useful for the planner—are lost in stochastic environments. Agents cannot reason effectively about uncertainty during planning, leading to poor sample efficiency and brittle policies that fail to generalize to novel situations or handle risk appropriately.\n",

            "2.  **Limitation of Separate Training:** Simply plugging a pre-trained stochastic world model (like STORM from Paper 1) into a planner misses the key insight of DTS. The world model would be trained to minimize global prediction error, which is different from being accurate in the specific, task-relevant regions of the state space that the planner explores.\n",
            "3.  **The S-DTS Advantage:** S-DTS integrates a **Variational Stochastic World Model (VS-WM)**, inspired by STORM's architecture, directly into the DTS framework. The core motivation is that **joint optimization provides a powerful, targeted learning signal**. The overall planning loss, `L_Q`, backpropagates through the entire differentiable search process, including the sampled transitions from the VS-WM. This teaches the VS-WM not just to be a good general predictor, but to be an accurate predictor *specifically for the transitions that matter most for making good decisions*. The planner, in turn, learns to account for the specific uncertainties expressed by its co-adapted world model. This synergy is expected to yield more robust and efficient learning.\n",

              "'<THINKING PAD>\\nI will now decode the expert feedback and plan my revision. My goal is to address every critical point, fix the technical flaws, and incorporate the constructive suggestions to strengthen the proposal.\\n\\n### Section 1: World Model Integration (Major Technical Flaw)\\n\\n- **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    - **Evaluator 2:** \"The write up treats STORM’s world model as a drop-in replacement for DTS’s deterministic MLP. But STORM is trained with a variational inference objective on 1-step transitions... storm cannot be used directly as a plug and play module.\"\\n    - **Evaluator 2:** \"In storm, training relies on a learned inference network to approximate the posterior for variational learning. This is never mentioned in the writeup. Without inference guidance, the latent dynamics may be undertrained. You cannot compute a valid KL divergence loss without the inference model.\"\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The original proposal is technically incorrect. It oversimplifies the integration by treating STORM\\'s world model as a simple stochastic transition function. I must replace this with the full variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture from STORM, which includes an encoder (the inference network), a decoder, and a dynamics model (the prior). The loss function for the world model must also be corrected to include the reconstruction loss and the two KL-divergence losses (dynamics and representation loss) that are central to STORM\\'s training.\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will rename the \"Stochastic Transition Module\" to a more accurate \"Variational Stochastic World Model (VS-WM)\" to reflect its true nature.\\n    2.  In the `Proposed Method` section, I will explicitly define the components of the VS-WM, citing STORM (Section 3.1):\\n        - **Encoder `q_ϕ(z_t | o_t)`:** This is the missing inference network. It takes an observation `o_t` and outputs a posterior distribution over latent states.\\n        - **Decoder `p_ϕ(o_t | z_t)`:** Reconstructs the observation from a latent state.\\n        - **Dynamics Predictor `g_ϕ(ẑ_{t+1}|h_t)`:** This is the transformer-based model that predicts the *prior* distribution of the next latent state based on history, which is what the planner will use.\\n    3.  In the `Training and Loss Functions` subsection, I will replace the single, incorrect `L_T_θ_STORM` with the full set of VAE losses from STORM (Eq. 3, 4a, 5a, 5b):\\n        -   **Reconstruction Loss (`L_rec`):** Ensures the latent space captures meaningful visual information.\\n        -   **Dynamics Loss (`L_dyn`):** Trains the dynamics predictor to match the posterior from the encoder. `KL[sg(q_ϕ) || g_ϕ]`.\\n        -   **Representation Loss (`L_rep`):** Regularizes the encoder to not deviate too far from the dynamics model\\'s predictions. `KL[q_ϕ || sg(g_ϕ)]`.\\n        -   The total world model loss will be a weighted sum (`L_WM = L_rec + β1*L_dyn + β2*L_rep + ...`).\\n\\n### Section 2: Tree Backup Mechanism (Major Technical Flaw)\\n\\n- **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    - **Evaluator 2:** \"In stochastic trees, value backups are not just max over children; you need to marginalize over sampled paths (like expected backups or softmax Bellman).\"\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The `Backup Phase` description in the original idea is incorrect for a stochastic environment. It performs a Bellman update based on a single sampled child, which ignores the distributional nature of the transitions.\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will rewrite the `Backup Phase` in the `Proposed Method` section to use a proper **Expected Backup Rule**.\\n    2.  The Q-value update for a node `N` and action `a` will be defined as: `Q(N, a) = R_θ(h_N, a) + γ * E_{h_child ~ P(h_child | h_N, a)}[V(h_child)]`, where `P` is the distribution predicted by the VS-WM.\\n    3.  I will state that this expectation will be practically approximated using **Monte Carlo estimation**. Specifically, we will sample `K` next states `h_child_k` from the predicted distribution and average their values: `Q(N, a) ≈ R_θ(h_N, a) + γ * (1/K) * Σ_{k=1..K} V(h_child_k)`.\\n    4.  The value of a node `N` will then be correctly calculated as `V(N) = max_a Q(N, a)`.\\n\\n### Section 3: Gradient Flow and Variance (High Risk)\\n\\n- **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    - **Evaluator 1:** \"Gradient variance explosion – two nested stochastic layers (transition sampling + REINFORCE) may drown the signal.\"\\n    - **Evaluator 3:** \"How exactly do gradients flow through the sampled transitions during tree expansion? The reparameterization trick works for continuous distributions, but what about discrete stochastic environments?\"\\n    - **Evaluator 1:** \"Variance-reduction effectiveness Experiment: Compare telescoping-sum alone vs. telescoping + per-node baselines vs. Gumbel-Softmax, recording gradient variance.\"\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The proposal needs to be more explicit about how gradients are handled for both the search policy and the stochastic world model, and it needs a stronger plan to mitigate the high variance.\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will add a new subsection in `Proposed Method` titled **\"Gradient Flow and Variance Reduction\"**.\\n    2.  This section will detail the two main gradient pathways:\\n        -   **Gradient through the World Model:** For continuous latent states, I will specify using the **reparameterization trick** (`h_child = μ + σ * ε`) to allow gradients from the planning loss `L_Q` to flow back into the world model `W_ϕ`. For discrete latent spaces (as used in STORM), I will specify using the **Gumbel-Softmax trick**.\\n        -   **Gradient for the Search Policy:** I will reiterate the use of REINFORCE with the **telescoping sum trick** from DTS (Section 3.5) as the primary variance reduction method.\\n    3.  I will add an explicit experiment to the `Proposed Experiment Outline`, as suggested by Evaluator 1, to empirically measure and compare the effectiveness of different variance reduction techniques on gradient stability during training.\\n\\n### Section 4: Computational Cost and Feasibility\\n\\n- **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    - **Evaluator 1:** \"Planner latency – even linear-attention Transformers inside hundreds of tree expansions can be a wall-clock killer.\"\\n    - **Evaluator 1/3:** \"Start with Tiny-DTS: 4-layer Performer, max tree depth 3, and show linear scaling charts.\"\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The experimental plan is too ambitious and doesn\\'t address the critical risk of computational infeasibility.\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  I will restructure the `Proposed Experiment Outline` into a **two-phase approach**:\\n        -   **Phase 1: Feasibility & Scaling Analysis.** This phase will use a \"Tiny S-DTS\" on the simpler stochastic grid worlds. Its goal is to benchmark performance and computational cost. I will explicitly state that we will plot wall-clock time against key parameters like {number of tree trials `T`, number of MC samples `K` for backups, Transformer depth}. This directly implements the reviewer\\'s suggestion.\\n        -   **Phase 2: Full Benchmark Evaluation.** Once feasibility is confirmed and parameters are tuned, this phase will scale up the model to run on stochastic Procgen and perform the full comparison against all baselines.\\n    2.  In `Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations`, I will update the mitigation for \"Computational Overhead\" to reflect this phased experimental plan, which is our primary risk-reduction strategy.\\n\\n### Section 5: Experimental Design, Baselines, and Metrics\\n\\n- **Quote the specific feedback:**\\n    - **Evaluator 3:** \"Have you considered simpler baselines like DTS with ensemble models or uncertainty quantification...?\"\\n    - **Evaluator 1:** \"Failure modes under rare but catastrophic outcomes Experiment: ...measure risk-adjusted returns (CVaR).\"\\n    - **Evaluator 1:** \"Generalisation to unseen stochasticity levels. Experiment: Train with slip = 20 %; test at 10 %, 30 %, 50 %. Observe degradation curves.\"\\n    - **Evaluator 1:** \"Does joint training really calibrate uncertainty? Experiment: Track KL-divergence between predicted transition distribution and empirical next-state histogram...\"\\n- **Identify what needs to change:** The experimental design can be made more rigorous with better baselines and more insightful metrics.\\n- **Explain how you\\'ll address it in the revision:**\\n    1.  **Add Baselines:** In the `Models for Comparison` subsection, I will add **\"DTS with Ensembles\"** as a crucial baseline. This method trains an ensemble of deterministic transition models and uses them within DTS, providing a strong alternative for handling uncertainty.\\n    2.  **Add Desrisking Experiments:** I will add the specific, targeted experiments suggested by Evaluator 1 into the experimental plan:\\n        -   An experiment in grid-world with a rare, catastrophic event, using **CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk)** as a metric.\\n        -   A generalization experiment to test on **unseen levels of stochasticity**.\\n        -   A world model analysis experiment to track **uncertainty calibration** (e.g., predicted vs. empirical KL-divergence).\\n    3.  **Clarify CQL:** I will clarify in the `Training and Loss Functions` section that the CQL loss (`L_D`) is applied to the final Q-values `Q_θ(s, a|τ)` returned by the search to regularize the agent\\'s effective policy in the offline setting, as done in the original DTS paper.\\n\\n### Pertinence of other feedback\\n- **Feedback not to address**: The suggestions to explore \"diffusion over graphs\" or deploy on a \"bimanual robot\" (from Evaluator 1\\'s \\'more_novel\\'/\\'more_audacious\\' sections) are excellent future work but are beyond the scope of making this initial idea feasible. My focus will be on the \"more_feasible\" feedback to ensure the core concept is sound and demonstrable first. I will acknowledge these as future directions in the conclusion.\\n\\nBy systematically applying these changes, I will transform the original idea from a technically flawed concept into a robust, feasible, and compelling research proposal that directly incorporates and addresses the expert feedback.\\n\\n<REVISED IDEA>\\n\\n## Generated Research Idea\\n\\n**Title:** Variational Differentiable Tree Search: End-to-End Planning in Latent Space for Stochastic Environments\\n\\n**Observed Phenomenon**\\nModel-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) methods that use online planning, such as Differentiable Tree Search (DTS), achieve strong performance by jointly optimizing a world model and a search algorithm. However, DTS and similar methods are designed for deterministic worlds. When deployed in non-deterministic environments, their deterministic world models fail to capture environmental stochasticity, leading them to learn an \"average\" world dynamic. This can result in sub-optimal or unsafe policies, as the planner is blind to low-probability, high-impact events.\\n\\n**Problem Statement:**\\nState-of-the-art differentiable search methods in MBRL are constrained by their reliance on deterministic world models, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that are inherently stochastic. While methods exist for learning stochastic world models (e.g., STORM), they are typically trained separately from the planner, which prevents the planner and model from co-adapting. This separation means the world model is not optimized for the specific states and transitions that are most critical for the planner\\'s decision-making process.\\n\\n*   *Condition:* We lack a framework that can jointly optimize a powerful, *stochastic* world model (capable of representing a distribution over next states) with a *differentiable tree search* algorithm in an end-to-end fashion.\\n*   *Consequence:* The benefits of differentiable planning—learning a world model that is specifically useful for the planner—are lost in stochastic environments. Agents cannot reason effectively about uncertainty during planning, leading to poor sample efficiency and brittle policies that fail to generalize to novel situations or handle risk appropriately.\\n\\n**Motivation:**\\nOur proposed method, Variational Differentiable Tree Search (S-DTS), aims to bridge this gap.\\n1.  **Limitation of DTS:** The original DTS (Paper 2) learns a deterministic transition function, which is fundamentally mismatched with stochastic environments. It cannot represent or plan for multiple possible outcomes of an action.\\n2.  **Limitation of Separate Training:** Simply plugging a pre-trained stochastic world model (like STORM from Paper 1) into a planner misses the key insight of DTS. The world model would be trained to minimize global prediction error, which is different from being accurate in the specific, task-relevant regions of the state space that the planner explores.\\n3.  **The S-DTS Advantage:** S-DTS integrates a **Variational Stochastic World Model (VS-WM)**, inspired by STORM\\'s architecture, directly into the DTS framework. The core motivation is that **joint optimization provides a powerful, targeted learning signal**. The overall planning loss, `L_Q`, backpropagates through the entire differentiable search process, including the sampled transitions from the VS-WM. This teaches the VS-WM not just to be a good general predictor, but to be an accurate predictor *specifically for the transitions that matter most for making good decisions*. The planner, in turn, learns to account for the specific uncertainties expressed by its co-adapted world model. This synergy is expected to yield more robust and efficient learning.\\n\\n**Hypothesis**\\nBy integrating a variational stochastic world model (VS-WM) into the Differentiable Tree Search (DTS) framework and jointly optimizing all components end-to-end—including the world model parameters, the value function, and the search policy—the resulting agent will achieve significantly superior performance, risk-adjusted returns, and generalization in non-deterministic environments compared to (a) the original DTS with a deterministic model, (b) DTS with an ensemble of deterministic models, and (c) methods using a separately trained stochastic world model with MCTS.\\n\\n**Proposed Method:**\\nS-DTS extends the DTS architecture by replacing its deterministic transition function with a full Variational Stochastic World Model (VS-WM) and adapting the search and backup mechanisms accordingly.\\n\\n**1. Variational Stochastic World Model (VS-WM)**\\nInspired by STORM (Paper 1, Section 3.1), the VS-WM consists of three jointly optimized components:\\n*   **Encoder `q_ϕ(z_t | o_t)`:** A CNN that acts as an inference network, mapping a real observation `o_t` to the parameters of a posterior distribution over latent states `z_t`. We use categorical distributions as in STORM.\\n*   **Decoder `p_ϕ(ô_t | z_t)`:** A deconvolutional network that reconstructs the observation `ô_t` from a latent state `z_t`.\\n*   **Dynamics Predictor `g_ϕ(P(ẑ_{t+1}) | h_t)`:** A GPT-like Transformer that takes a sequence of latent-action embeddings and outputs the parameters of the *prior* distribution `P(ẑ_{t+1})` over the next latent state. This is the predictive model used by the planner.\\n\\n**2. Online Search in Latent Space**\\nThe search process follows DTS but is adapted for the VS-WM.\\n*   **Expansion Phase:** The best-first search, guided by the stochastic tree expansion policy `π_θ`, selects a node `N*` to expand. For each action `a`:\\n    1.  The dynamics predictor `g_ϕ` is used to get the prior distribution over the next latent state: `P(ẑ_{child} | h_{N*}, a)`.\\n    2.  A next latent state `ẑ_child` is **sampled** from this distribution. To enable gradient flow, this sampling is made differentiable using the **Gumbel-Softmax trick** for the categorical latent variables.\\n    3.  The new node is added to the tree.\\n*   **Backup Phase (Expected Backups):** Value backups must account for transition stochasticity. The Q-value for a node `N` and action `a` is the expected value over possible next states:\\n    `Q(N, a) = R_θ(h_N, a) + γ * E_{ẑ_child ~ P(ẑ_child | h_N, a)}[V(ẑ_child)]`\\n    This expectation is approximated using **Monte Carlo estimation** by drawing `K` samples from the dynamics predictor and averaging their values:\\n    `Q(N, a) ≈ R_θ(h_N, a) + γ * (1/K) * Σ_{k=1 to K} V(ẑ_{child,k})`\\n    The node\\'s value is then `V(N) = max_a Q(N, a)`.\\n\\n**3. Gradient Flow and Variance Reduction**\\nWe have two sources of stochasticity, each requiring careful gradient management:\\n*   **Gradient through World Model:** The Gumbel-Softmax trick allows the end-to-end planning loss `L_Q` to flow back through the sampling step in the expansion phase, providing a direct optimization signal to the Dynamics Predictor `g_ϕ`.\\n*   **Gradient for Search Policy:** The search policy `π_θ` is trained via REINFORCE. To combat high variance, we use the **telescoping sum trick** from DTS (Paper 2, Section 3.5) and add a learned value function as a baseline.\\n\\n**4. Training and Loss Functions**\\nThe entire S-DTS model is trained end-to-end on a composite loss:\\n`L_total = λ_Q * L_Q + λ_D * L_D + L_WM`\\n*   `L_Q`: The primary RL loss (e.g., MSE between search output `Q_θ(s,a|τ)` and target Q-values).\\n*   `L_D`: The Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) loss from DTS (Paper 2, Eq. 10), applied to the final `Q_θ(s,a|τ)` values to regularize the policy in offline settings.\\n*   `L_WM`: The world model loss, adapted from STORM (Paper 1, Eq. 3), ensures the learned latent space is well-structured:\\n    `L_WM = L_rec + β1*L_dyn + β2*L_rep`\\n    *   `L_rec`: Reconstruction loss (`||o - ô||²`) from the decoder.\\n    *   `L_dyn`: Dynamics loss `KL[sg(q_ϕ) || g_ϕ]` to train the predictor.\\n    *   `L_rep`: Representation loss `KL[q_ϕ || sg(g_ϕ)]` to regularize the encoder.\\n\\n**Proposed Experiment Outline:**\\nThe experimental plan is structured in two phases to manage technical risk.\\n\\n**Phase 1: Feasibility & Scaling Analysis**\\n*   **Environment:** Custom stochastic grid worlds (e.g., \"slippery ice\") where stochasticity can be precisely controlled.\\n*   **Model:** A \"Tiny S-DTS\" with a small (e.g., 2-layer, as in STORM) Transformer and limited tree trials.\\n*   **Goal:**\\n    1.  Verify the stability of the end-to-end training pipeline.\\n    2.  Benchmark computational cost. **Primary Metric:** Plot wall-clock time vs. {number of tree trials `T`, MC samples `K`, Transformer depth}.\\n    3.  Compare variance reduction techniques (telescoping sum vs. baselines).\\n\\n**Phase 2: Full Benchmark Evaluation**\\n*   **Environments:**\\n    1.  Stochastic Grid World with rare catastrophic events.\\n    2.  Stochastic Procgen: Introduce probabilistic elements (e.g., enemy movement, action outcomes) to a subset of Procgen games (\\'climber\\', \\'ninja\\').\\n*   **Models for Comparison:**\\n    1.  **S-DTS (Proposed)**\\n    2.  **DTS with Ensembles (Baseline 1):** The original DTS using an ensemble of 5 deterministic transition models to capture uncertainty.\\n    3.  **DTS-Deterministic (Baseline 2):** The original DTS from Paper 2.\\n    4.  **MCTS + Separately Trained VS-WM (Baseline 3):** Train our VS-WM using only `L_WM`, then use it with a standard MCTS planner.\\n    5.  **Model-Free Baseline (e.g., CQL):** A strong model-free baseline.\\n*   **Primary & Secondary Success Criteria and Metrics:**\\n    *   **Performance:** Average cumulative reward.\\n    *   **Risk-Sensitivity:** **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)** on the catastrophic grid world to measure performance in the worst-case outcomes.\\n    *   **Generalization:** Train on one level of stochasticity (e.g., 20% slip) and test on unseen levels (10%, 40%) to plot **degradation curves**.\\n    *   **Uncertainty Calibration:** Track the **KL-divergence** between the VS-WM\\'s predicted transition distribution and the empirical distribution of next states on a held-out dataset.\\n    *   **Sample Efficiency:** Performance as a function of training steps/data.\\n\\n**Concrete Example:**\\nConsider the \"slippery ice\" grid world from the original idea, where `move_north` can result in slipping left or right. A pit with a large negative reward is nearby.\\n*   **DTS with Ensembles (Baseline):** An ensemble of deterministic models might each predict a different, but fixed, outcome. The planner might average these paths or see variance in predictions, but it doesn\\'t reason about the *probability* of each outcome. It might still choose a path close to the pit if the average path seems safe.\\n*   **S-DTS (Proposed):** The VS-WM predicts a *single distribution* over next states, `P(z\\') = {0.7: north, 0.15: slip-left, 0.15: slip-right}`. The expected backup rule `E[V(z\\')]` explicitly incorporates the low-probability, high-cost outcome of slipping into the pit. The `Q(N, move_north)` value will be lower if the slip outcomes lead to the pit. Consequently, the S-DTS planner will learn to select a safer path that is further from the pit, even if it is slightly longer, demonstrating superior risk-awareness.\\n\\n**Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations**\\n*   **Risk 1 – Training Instability:** The interaction of REINFORCE, Gumbel-Softmax sampling, and VAE losses can be highly volatile.\\n    *   **Fallback:** Our phased approach allows us to debug this on simpler environments first. We will use robust variance reduction (telescoping sum + baseline), gradient clipping, and entropy regularization for both the search policy and the world model\\'s output distribution to prevent premature collapse.\\n*   **Risk 2 – Computational Overhead:** The triple loop of training steps, search trials, and MC samples for backups with a Transformer model is very expensive.\\n    *   **Fallback:** Our feasibility analysis (Phase 1) is designed to find a workable trade-off. We will start with an efficient Transformer (as in STORM) and small `T` and `K` values, scaling up only as the budget allows.\\n*   **Risk 3 – Inaccurate World Model:** The VS-WM might fail to learn the true stochastic dynamics, especially rare events.\\n    *   **Fallback:** We can adjust the weights of the loss terms (e.g., increase `β1` on `L_dyn` or the weight of `L_Q`). Curriculum learning, starting with deterministic and gradually increasing stochasticity, can guide the model. The joint optimization with the `L_Q` signal is our main tool to force the model to be accurate where it matters.'"
